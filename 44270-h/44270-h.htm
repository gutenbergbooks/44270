<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>The following pages have been written for the
general reader. The controversies over the interpretation
of the curious markings of Mars and the
wide divergence of opinion as to their nature first
turned my attention to the matter. The question
of intelligence in other worlds is of perennial
interest to everyone, and that question may
possibly be settled by an unprejudiced study of
our neighboring planet Mars. Knowing the
many analogies between Mars and the Earth, we
are justified in asking what conditions really
exist in Mars. Instead of flouting at every attempt
to interpret the various and complicated
markings of its surface, we should soberly consider
any rational explanation of these enigmas
from the postulate that the two spheres, so near
together in space, cannot be so far apart physically,
and from the fact that as intelligence is
broadly modifying the appearance of the surface
of the Earth, a similar intelligence may also be
marking the face of Mars.</p>

<p>A student familiar with a general knowledge
of the heavens, a fair acquaintance with the
surface features of the Earth, with an appreciation
of the doctrine of probabilities, and capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
of estimating the value of evidence, is quite as
well equipped to examine and discuss the nature
of the markings of Mars as the astronomer. If,
furthermore, he is gifted with imagination and
is free from all prejudice in the matter, he may
have a slight advantage. Astronomers are probably
the most exact of all students as to their
facts, and in this discussion there is no attempt
to introduce evidence they do not supply, as
the frequent quotations from their writings will
show.</p>

<p>Having studied Mars through nearly one presentation
of the planet with the great refractor at
the Lowell Observatory, what I saw with my
own eyes, uninfluenced by what others saw, will
be presented in a short chapter at the end of
this book.</p>

<p>I wish to express my obligations to Professor
Percival Lowell for the privileges of his observatory,
for many of the illustrations in this book,
and for his unbounded hospitality during my
visit to Flagstaff. I am also deeply indebted to
Mr. Russell Robb for valuable assistance during
the preparation of the manuscript.</p>

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>

<p>Had some one asked, fifty years ago, Is the
Sun composed of chemical elements with which
we are familiar? Shall we ever know? the
question would not have been deemed worthy
of a second thought. Realizing what has been
accomplished, not only regarding the constitution
of the Sun, but of the most remote stars, we
are encouraged to ask: Is Mars inhabited? Shall
we ever know? To what groups of students
are we to appeal for an answer? If we want to
know the diameter of Mars, its weight, the form
of its orbit, the inclination of its axis, the period
of its revolution around the Sun, and its rotation
period, its ephemeris and its albedo, we ask the
astronomer, for he has the instruments with
which to observe and measure, and the mathematical
knowledge necessary to reduce the
measurements. If Mars were incandescent, we
should appeal to the astrophysicist for information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
regarding its chemical composition. If,
however, we want to know the probability of
Mars being the abode of life, we should appeal to
one who is familiar with the conditions of life
upon our own globe. If the question is asked as
to the existence of intelligence on the planet, we
endeavor to trace evidences of its surface markings,
and their character, whether natural or
artificial. Knowing how profoundly man has
changed the appearance of the surface features
of our own globe in the removal of vast forests,
in the irrigation of enormous tracts of sterile
plain, the filling up of certain areas, like Peking,
Tokio, London, with material having a different
reflecting surface, we are to scan the surface of
Mars for similar modifications, and for an answer
ask those who are familiar with physical geography,
with meteorology, with geology, including
the character of natural cracks or crannies, deep
cañon, or range of mountains, or any of the great
cataclysms which have scarred the face of the
Earth. Taking the great mass of facts as they
are presented to us by astronomers, to what class
are we to appeal as to the probability of life in
other worlds? What class will form the most
rational conclusions? Will it be the circle-squarers,
perpetual-motion cranks, spiritualists,
survivals of a past who believe the world is flat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
those who have "anthropomorphic conceptions
of the Supreme" and Hebraic conceptions of the
origin of things, or will it be those who value
observation and experiment, who appreciate the
importance of large numbers, and who are
endowed with a tithe of imagination? Most
certainly the latter class.</p>

<p>In approaching the interpretation of the markings
of Mars we should first glance at a brief
historical summary of what has already been
done. We should examine the testimony of
those who have seen and drawn the canals; we
are then better prepared to examine the records
of the latest observations and the explanation of
their nature. In the meantime an inquiry must
be made as to whether the mathematical astronomer,
after all, is best fitted to judge of the surface
features of a planet. Next we should take
up in the following order the evidences, which are
overwhelming, that a network of lines, geodetic
in their character, mark the surface of Mars. It
has been claimed that these lines show the
result of irrigation, and, therefore, the irrigation
features of our own planet should be examined.
It has been objected that many astronomers have
not been able to see the markings, and consequently
their existence has been doubted. It
will then be proper to point out that the difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
of seeing are very great, and that the
acutest eyesight, coupled with long practice, is
necessary to recognize the markings. It has
been objected that the drawings of the minuter
details of Mars vary with different observers. It
will be necessary to show that every kind of
research employing graphic representation labors
under the same difficulty, and none more so than
astronomy. It has been objected that there is
not sufficient moisture and atmosphere in Mars
to sustain life, and this must be answered by
those only who are familiar with conditions
affecting life on our own planet.</p>

<p>Various theories have been advanced, some of
them physical, to explain the markings of Mars,
and these must be considered, and, if possible,
answered. Comments and criticism are difficult
to repress, as the discoveries of Schiaparelli and
the additional discoveries and deductions of
Lowell have evoked discussions, which, in some
instances, have been harsh and unreasonable, and,
in one case, positively ridiculous. Schiaparelli has
been called an impostor, and Lowell has come in
for his full share of vituperation and innuendo.
If this portion of the discussion is considered
unparliamentary, the attitude and language of
certain astronomers have provoked it.</p>

<p>A brief account is presented of what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
author was enabled to draw of the Martian
details, with a transcript of his notes made at
the time of observation, and finally a little
imaginary sketch is given as to how the world
would look from Mars; and if similar kinds of
astronomers existed there, what comments and
objections they might offer as to the inhabitability
of the Earth.</p>

<p>Such flights of the imagination are justified in
that it gives one a chance to appreciate the
weakness of some of the arguments urged against
the idea of intelligence in Mars.</p>

<p>It will be objected that some of the names
herein quoted are not recognized as astronomers.
I can only say that in every instance I have
found references to the writings and essays of
those that might be objected to in the pages
of the "Observatory," and other reputable astronomical
journals, and in no instances accompanied
by adverse comment or criticism. If
astronomers&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;even the distinguished Schiaparelli&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;quote
these names in scientific memoirs,
I may venture to do the same in a book written
for the general reader. The objection, however,
has always presented itself with every controversy;
it was conspicuously marked in the
passionate discussions over Darwin's "Origin of
Species." The intelligent laity recognized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
truth of Darwin's proposition long before the
zoölogist began to waver. Essays by the unprofessional
supporting Darwin's contention were
discredited because the writers were not trained
naturalists. The history of invention is crowded
with instances where devices and processes have
been invented by men whose trades or professions
were the least likely to enable them to originate
such ideas.</p>

<p>Until within recent centuries, man has not
only believed that he and his kind were the only
intelligent creatures in the universe, but that the
little round ball on which he lived was the dominant
part thereof. So rooted for ages was this
conviction that it became fixed in man's mental
structure, and hence the survival of the idea that
still lingers in the minds of a few to-day. The
conclusion was natural, however, for the behavior
of the starry heavens and the Sun and the Moon
seemed sufficient evidence that man, and the surface
upon which he lived, was the centre of the
universe. The stars were bright points of light,
the Moon a silver disk, and the Sun a heat and
light giving ball of fire, equally diminutive and
not far away. Let one realize for a moment the
experience of these early people. Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
aerial, with the exception of feathery birds, fluffy
bats and flying insects, was composed of the lightest
particles&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;cottony seeds, reluctantly falling
snow-flakes, motes in the air, smoke and vaporous
cloud, and, in contrast, the rock-foundationed and
irregular surface upon which the people dwelt,
and flat as far as man had reached. What wonder,
then, that man viewed these brilliant points and
dazzling disks as objects of no great size and not far
away, hauled across the heavens by unseen spirits
of some kind. The marvel of it all is, not that
they believed as they did, but that any other
views of cosmography could have been established.
And yet the successive increments of
astronomical knowledge, founded apparently on
the soundest mathematics, were adopted in their
turn. What more convincing than the epicyclic
theory of Ptolemy, buttressed by figures so ingenious
and convincing, that the theory might
have lasted till now except for the truer understanding
of planetary movements in relation to
that of the Earth? All through this history are
found traces of the barriers erected by prejudiced
conservatives, of which the attitude of Tycho
Brahe is a good example, though in this case it
was probably his belief in the Hebraic conception
of the universe which excited his opposition to
Kepler's views, a conception which, unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
for the progress of astronomical research, still
lingers among certain observers to-day and places
them in precisely the same category with Tycho
Brahe.</p>

<p>With the gradual accumulation of knowledge
it was found that of all the innumerable illuminated
bodies in the heavens, only one,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;just one,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
Moon, revolved around the Earth, and
that the Earth instead of being all dominant in
the affairs of the universe, played a very minor
part, and, instead of being master, was a very
humble midget revolving around the Sun; that,
indeed, with the exception of the Moon, there
were visible to the naked eye only three bright
points of light in the whole range of the heavens
more insignificant in size,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Mercury, Venus, and
Mars,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;while the other planets were vastly
larger, and had many more satellites revolving
around them. Then it was found that, with the
exception of the few planets, the myriad stars
had no connection with the Sun whatsoever,
that the Sun was no longer the centre of a great
universe. Later it was discovered through spectroscopic
analysis that all the myriad of stars
were composed of chemical elements similar to
our Sun. Here, then, was the startling revelation
that our Sun was simply a star, and that the stars
represented a "universe of Suns," and, if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
could get near any one star of the millions that
sparkle in the heavens telescopically, we should
see it as a round ball emitting light and heat. It
was perhaps humiliating to find that our Sun
was so insignificant in size that from Sirius, for
example, it could not be seen with the naked
eye, so small indeed that in the close companionship
of other stars it would be swallowed up by
their greater size and brilliancy.</p>

<p>To assume, then, that our Sun, so identical to
the stars in heat and light emitting properties,
was the only Sun that had revolving around it a
few minute balls, would be as absurd as if one
should go on a pebbly beach, extending from
Labrador to Florida for example, and picking
up a single pebble, should have the hardihood to
assert that this pebble was the only one, among
the millions of pebbles, upon which would be
found the bits of seaweed and little snails which
it might support. The overwhelming vastness
of the universe is entirely beyond the grasp of
the human mind. The mere statement that it
requires so many years for the light to reach us
from a certain star, the parallax of which has
been rudely established, affords one only a faint
glimmer of the truth. The swing of our Earth
about the Sun gives us a base line of 186,000,000
of miles, and yet, with this enormous base from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
which to subtend an angle, only a very few of
the myriad of stars show the slightest displacement;
the others exhibit no more signs of divergence
than if while looking at them we had
simply moved our heads from one side to the
other! Fixed stars they appear to be, and are
so called, though we are told they are all drifting
in various directions, as our star-Sun is.</p>

<p>Only by reducing all these vast distances and
dimensions to a minute scale can the mind realize
the futility of ever comprehending the illimitable
distances of space.</p>

<p>In order to consider the attitude of the Earth
in relation to the Sun and the nearest fixed star,
we will reduce the Sun's diameter of 866,000
miles to the dimensions of a ball one inch in
diameter; the Earth reduced to the same scale
would be a minute speck less than one one-hundredth
of an inch in diameter; a perforation
in paper made by the finest cambric needle would
represent the size of this minute speck, the
Earth. Following this scale we should place
this speck nine feet from the inch ball, this
distance representing 93,000,000 of miles, the
Earth's distance from the Sun; Mars would be
a still smaller speck a step farther off. Let us
now proceed to Boston Common, for example,
and on the smooth playground place our inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
ball representing the Sun; taking three good
steps we should place our minute speck, representing
the Earth, upon the ground where it
would be immediately lost in the fine gravel;
another step and we would place a still smaller
particle, representing Mars. How big a circle on
the Earth's surface, using the inch ball as a centre,
should we have to describe in order to include
the nearest fixed star? Such a circle would
reach to Detroit, Michigan, and Columbus, Ohio,
or Wilmington, North Carolina! To find a
circle which would include eight other fixed stars
next in distance, and only eight of the thousands
which render the heavens so beautiful on a clear
winter's night&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;we should run such a circle
through the centre of Hudson Bay, the waters
of southern Greenland, Lake Winnipeg, and New
Orleans!</p>

<p>In this broad way only can we form a dim
conception of the overwhelming distances of
space, and, in this absolutely unthinkable space,
our little Sun, with its constant rain of meteoric
dust, an occasional comet, and its microscopic
planets are literally bunched together. To admit,
as we must then, that one of these motes has
had irrigating canals on various parts of its surface
since prehistoric times, and the other mote
has nothing of the sort despite the geodetic lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
that are seen marking its surface, is simply
preposterous. Their disposition, their visibility
coincident with the Martian summer, becoming
apparent only when the snow caps melt, their
convergence towards centres of distribution, all
go to prove by the simplest analogy an identity
of structure. Certainly the overwhelming force
of Lowell's observations and arguments baffles
any other reasonable explanation of the character
and purpose of these markings. Here are the
lines, some following the arcs of great circles,
all appearing precisely when they should appear,
and in progressive strength from the north when
the vivifying water from the melting snow cap
first starts the vegetation. Why certain parallels
or doublings are observed in some of the canals
is about as puzzling to us as the checkerboard
townships of the West would appear to a Martian,
where some would be yellow with the ripening
grain while others, uncultivated, would appear of
a different color.</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="smcap">Tyndall.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>It would be a waste of time to attempt an
interpretation of the markings of Mars as a
result of intelligent effort, if it could be proved
beyond a reasonable doubt that our globe was
not only unique among the bodies which probably
accompany the innumerable suns, but was
the only body, among them all, sustaining
creatures of intelligence. If life exists in other
planets of a nature with which we are familiar,
then the physical conditions must be similar to
those of our own planet. Later we shall point
out the infinite variety of conditions under which
life&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;even man&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;exists on this globe, and it
will be shown that the question of higher or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
lower temperature, more or less humidity, higher
or lower atmospheric pressure, greater or less
force of gravity, can have but little weight in
discussing the probability of life in other worlds.</p>

<p>In a planet devoid of atmosphere, or a sphere
glowing with its own heat, we may decide without
question that life does not exist. Even in a
globe in many respects like our own it would be
hazardous to conjecture the kinds of organic
forms in which it is manifested. Reasoning from
analogy, if life exists in Mars, or other spheres
in infinite space, it must have originated under
much the same conditions as it originated here;
at the outset the most primitive bits of protoplasm.
But has life appeared in Mars? Tyndall,
in graphic words, pictures the rounding of
worlds from nebulous haze, and then says, "For
eons, the immensity of which overwhelms man's
conception, the Earth was unfit to maintain what
we call life. It is now covered with visible living
things. They are not formed of matter different
from that around them. They are, on the contrary,
bone of its bone and flesh of its flesh."
Mars must come in the same category. It is a
part of the original nidus from which our world
was condensed, and however life originated in
the past, the conditions for its origin, at least,
must have been as favorable on the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Mars, as on the surface of the Earth, and, so far
as we know to the contrary, even more favorable.
In the beginning, Mars cooled and hardened with
all those behaviors of contraction, condensation
of vapor on its surface, erosion, etc., and it is
impossible to avoid the conviction that life, as on
our Earth, arose under the same physical conditions.
Recalling the resemblance which Mars
bears to the Earth, and the data which have
already been established, we behold a world in
many respects like ours, with its sunsets and sunrises,
winds that sweep over its surface, the dust
storms from the deserts, its snow-storms and
snow-drifts, its dazzling fields of white in the
north, with an occasional snow-storm that whitens
the planet far down in latitude; the seasonal
changes, and, most important of all, the melting
ice caps, with rivulets and torrents, temporary
arctic seas and frozen pools, its great expanses
of vegetation and sterile plains. We have in
Mars the variety of conditions under which life
has assumed its infinite variety of aspects on the
Earth, and which, by analogy, should have passed
through similar stages in Mars. Life at the
outset must have been protoplasmic; then came
contractile tissue, muscular bundles, hardened
structures within and without for their support,
nerves to animate the muscles, and protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
for nerve-trunk, either rigid or flexible. Hard
parts might vary under a different force of gravity,
though there might appear types of structure
that could be classified with our own.</p>

<p>All such conditions, however, are mere surmises,
for about such matters we can reason only
from analogy. The first proposition to establish
is that the conception of the plurality of worlds
is not unreasonable, and second, that many of
the most eminent astronomers have believed in
the inhabitability of other worlds, and this justifies
a reasonable man to follow the inquiry. The
belief is based upon legitimate analogies which
have thus far guided man in every generalization,
in the establishment of principles, and are
continually appealed to in the details of every
day's experience.</p>

<p>From remote times it has been taken for
granted by the best minds that other worlds
besides ours sustain life. The early belief in the
plurality of worlds was based on the idea that
since spheres like ours had been fashioned by the
Almighty they must have been made for the
same purpose for which our globe seemed intended,
to sustain life, and Scripture was freely
quoted in support of the idea.</p>

<p>Sir David Brewster, in his book "More
Worlds Than One," says that the doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the plurality of worlds was maintained by almost
all the distinguished astronomers and writers
who have flourished since the true figure of the
Earth was determined: "Giordano Bruno of
Nola, Kepler, and Tycho believed in it; and
Cardinal Cusa and Bruno, before the discovery
of binary systems among the stars, believed also
that the stars were inhabited. Sir Isaac Newton
likewise adopted it, and Dr. Bentley, Master of
Trinity College, in his eighth sermon on the
Confutation of Atheism from the origin and
frame of the world, has ably maintained the
same doctrine. In our own day we may number
among its supporters the distinguished names of
Laplace, Sir William and Sir John Herschel, Dr.
Chalmers, Isaac Taylor, and M. Arago."</p>

<p>The attitude of the intelligent world to-day
is well shown in a recent number of London
"Nature," where in a review of a book by
Wallace, endeavoring to show that this world
alone sustains life, the reviewer ends by saying:
"To consider this Earth as the only inhabited
body in the stellar universe, a reversion to prehistoric
ideas, may or may not be an advance,
but it will require very strong arguments before
we can be brought to consider that its isolation
in the Cosmos is indeed a fact." Until the discovery
by Schiaparelli of the network of lines in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Mars, laid out with seemingly intelligent precision,
the arguments for the inhabitability of
other worlds were based entirely upon analogy.
Sir Richard Owen, the great comparative anatomist,
in supporting the contention that life existed
in other planets, said: "The grounds of
belief vary with the probability of a proposition;
if nothing better than analogy can be had&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;on
analogy will belief be based."</p>

<p>Professor O. M. Mitchell, the first director of
the Cincinnati Observatory, in his work on
"Popular Astronomy," says, in regard to the
doctrine of the plurality of worlds: "It would
be most incredible to assert, as some have done,
that our planet, so small and insignificant in its
proportions when compared with other planets
with which it is allied, is the only world in the
whole universe filled with sentient, rational and
intelligent beings capable of comprehending the
grand mysteries of the physical universe."</p>

<p>The eminent French astronomer, M. Flammarion,
has, in an eloquent passage in his "Plurality
of Worlds," portrayed the vastness of the
universe and the utter insignificance of our Earth
in the immensity of space: "If advancing with
the velocity of <span class="locked">light<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> we could traverse from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
century to century this unlimited number of
suns and spheres without ever meeting any limit
to this prodigious immensity where God brings
forth worlds and beings; looking behind, but no
longer knowing in what part of the infinite to
find this grain of dust called the Earth, we
should stop fascinated and confounded by such
a spectacle, and uniting our voice to the concert
of universal nature we should say from the
depths of our soul, Almighty God! how senseless
we were to believe that there was nothing
beyond the Earth, and that our abode alone
possessed the privilege of reflecting thy greatness
and honor."</p>

<p>Compare these elevating thoughts with the
shrunken attitude of one who has the conceit to
imagine that he and his kind are not only alone
in the universe but superadds to this monstrous
conception the idea that the millions of great
suns are designedly waltzing around solely for
his edification and amusement, unmindful of the
heedless way in which the millions of his race
regard the overpowering majesty of the heavens.
To the thousand millions that live to-day, and the
thousand, thousand millions that have perished
in the past, the starry heavens have never excited
an emotion grateful, reverent, or curious,
unless a flaming comet, or an eclipse of the Sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
or Moon occurred, and then with superstitious
fear have they gone grovelling in the dust.</p>

<p>An astronomer imbued with Hebraic conceptions
of the universe is poorly equipped to appreciate
the arguments in favor of life in other
worlds. He may be keen in perceiving lines in
the spectrum, and the significance of their lateral
displacement, but possessed with a belief&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
result of early training&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that a little two-legged
human molecule could command the Sun
and Moon to stand still, a realization of his own
insignificance, or the possibility of intelligence
in other worlds, must forever remain beyond his
grasp. Emerson said "the dogmas shrivel as
dry leaves at the door of the observatory."
They never shrivel for such minds, but grow and
flourish with a density that obscures by, its rankness
every rational conception of the heavens
above. As an illustration of the attitude of
such mentalities we have to go back fifty years,
for few survive to-day. Edward Hitchcock, Professor
of Geology and Theology at Amherst,
wrote a book just fifty years ago entitled "Plurality
of Worlds," in which he denounces the
idea; but observe the precise way in which he
lays down the law: "The planets had no vital
tendencies, they could have had such given only
by an additional act or series of acts of creative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
power. As mere inert globes, they had no
settled destiny to be the seats of life; they could
have had such a destiny only by the appointment
of Him who creates living things and
puts them in the places which he chooses for
them" (page 352).</p>

<p>It may be objected that it is useless to bring
up these old theological conceptions, as the world
has happily gone beyond them, and only in an
atavistic manner do we find a few still holding
them; nevertheless it may be safely asserted that
fifty years hence we shall look back upon the
attitude of certain astronomers to-day with much
the same pity and amusement which excites us
when we regard the attitude of a similar class
in the middle of the last century.</p>

<p>Tyndall expresses the universal belief of
thinkers in whatever line of work, that life is by
no means confined to this Earth. He says:
"Whether the other fixed stars have similar
planetary companions or not is to us a matter of
pure conjecture, which may or may not enter
into our conception of the universe. But probably
every thoughtful man believes, with regard
to these distant Suns, that there is, in
space, something besides our system on which
they shine."</p>

<p>One class of objectors to the idea that other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
worlds are inhabited endeavors to show that our
position in the universe is unique, that the solar
system itself is quite unlike anything existing
elsewhere, and, to cap the climax, that our own
little world has just the right amount of water,
air, and gravitational force to enable it to be the
abode of intelligent life, and nowhere else in the
broad expanse of heaven can such physical habitudes
be found as will enable life to originate or
to exist!</p>

<p>In a memoir on the "Evolution of the Solar
System," by Professor T.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;J. See, the author,
while not denying the possibility of other systems
like our own, still considers our system
unique. Here are his words: "Therefore, while
observation gives us no grounds for denying the
existence of other systems like our own, it does
not enable us to affirm, or even to render probable,
that such systems do exist." Because a
number of binary stars have been discovered in
which the two stars are nearly equal in mass, and
their orbits highly eccentric, he therefore concludes
that the millions of stars that stud the
heavens are probably without satellites. The
unreasonableness of this attitude is emphasized
by realizing that these innumerable suns are
similar to our own Sun, as revealed by the
spectroscope, and have a similar eruptive energy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Professor Newcomb, however, says: "Evidence
is continually increasing that dark and opaque
worlds like ours exist and revolve around their
primaries." Had Mr. See discovered that every
star of the many million was accompanied by
another star nearly equal in mass, with its
marked eccentric behavior, then only would he
be justified in his inference that our solar system
was indeed unique. When one realizes that the
stars are at such unimaginable distances that
the highest powers of the telescope reveal even
the nearest of them only as points of light&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not
as disks&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and when one further realizes
that the satellites of our Sun, even the largest
of them, are diminutive globes compared to the
vastness of the Sun, it seems unreasonable if not
impossible to entertain the idea that none of
these remote stars are accompanied by satellites,
and that, therefore, this little Sun of ours stands
without parallel in the universe.</p>

<p>Tyndall, in his famous reply to the critics of
his Belfast address, in speaking of the origin of
life, referred to the Nebular Theory as follows:
"According to it our sun and planets were once
diffused through space as an impalpable haze out
of which by condensation came the solar system.
What caused it to condense? Loss of heat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>What rounded the sun and planets? That
which rounds a tear, molecular force." In these
terse and graphic expressions we are made to
understand the universality of law. So far as
we have sounded the depths of the stellar universe
we see the same obedience to gravitational
laws, the same flashing lines in the spectrum.
We encounter no phenomena that cannot be
explained, or at least inferred, by the knowledge
we have obtained from our little mote of the
Cosmos.</p>

<p>Mr. See thinks it remarkable that "previous
investigators have almost invariably approached
the problem of cosmogony from the point of
view of the planets and satellites, and that no
considerable attempt has been made to inquire
into the development of the great number of
systems observed among the fixed stars." It is
true our planetary system has been used as a
standard of measurement for the universe, and a
very comprehensive standard it has proved to be.
The law of universal gravitation was based on
terrestrial and lunar observations, spectroscopic
analysis was determined in a terrestrial laboratory.
As George Iles says, a coal of fire may be
raked from a grate and broken up to illustrate the
rapid cooling of smaller masses. Even a child's
spinning top may be used in an astronomical
lecture. The study of our Sun led to the study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
of the fixed stars, and so our little system has
thus far furnished us with examples and illustrations
by which we interpret the universe.</p>

<p>In our solar system we have a fair sample
of the Cosmos in miniature, though our Sun is
so modest in size, compared with the great orbs
that appeal to us by their number and brilliancy.
So far as our telescopes have sounded the heavens
we find nebulous clouds in their structure showing
inchoate masses, orbital and spiral arrangements,
condensations in their centres. We have
the binaries with their extraordinary properties,
we have variables with their dark bodies revolving
around their primaries. In our little
system we also have dark bodies revolving
around a luminous primary, from one of which
we endeavor to interpret the mysteries of the
universe; we have loose masses, as in comets with
enormously elongated orbits; we have spheres of
insignificant size, with small bodies revolving
around them, and these epitomes revolving
around a central sun; we have one of these
bodies with meteoric rings; and, in the case of
our own globe, a satellite of such size that except
in the form of its orbit it might well represent
a binary in embryo;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and, finally, a host
of bodies big enough to reflect the rays of the
sun, pursuing their various orbital paths. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
are told that the stars are as distant from
each other as we are from them. We may regard
these systems of nebulæ, variables, doubles,
etc., as different kinds or species of heavenly
bodies; and to assert that our system is the only
individual of the species in the universe seems
contrary to all celestial analogy, for do we not
have hundreds of binaries, thousands of variables,
millions of suns, revealing the same fiery energy
and consuming the same elemental fuel?</p>

<p>Professor Newcomb in his "Reminiscences"
describes his first sweeping the heavens, at random,
with the then new twenty-six inch refractor
at the Naval Observatory and discovering a little
cluster of stars so small and faint that the individual
stars eluded even the great power of this
instrument. He says: "I could not help the
vain longing which one must sometimes feel
under such circumstances, to know what beings
might live on planets belonging to what, from
an earthly point of view, seemed to be on the
border of creation itself." One would suppose
that this expression of a longing to ascertain the
character of the beings inhabiting planets circling
these distant suns would induce one to study a
planet analogous to our Earth, and so near in
comparison to these unimaginable distances as to
be within a hand's grasp, so to speak. The little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
interest Professor Newcomb has taken in the
subject is well expressed in his late book "Astronomy
for Everybody." In his chapter on
Mars, in which <em>Everybody</em> is certainly interested,
he says: "The reader will excuse me for saying
anything in this chapter about the possible inhabitants
of Mars. He knows just as much of
the subject as I do, and that is nothing at all."
He might at least have given the various
pronouncements of Schiaparelli, Lowell, and
others as to the probable character of these remarkable
markings on Mars, and their supposed
significance.</p>

<p>While Professor Newcomb's attitude on the
question of the plurality of worlds has been
somewhat conservative in the past he has lately,
however, expressed himself on the question in
no uncertain terms. In a recent article in
"Harper's Magazine," entitled "Probability of
Life in Other Worlds," he has lent his sanction
to the rational idea that other worlds may be the
abode of intelligent creatures. His recognition
of the principle will do much to offset the influence
if it ever had any, of a recent book published
in England by Alfred Russel Wallace, in
which the distinguished author attempts to show
that this world stands alone as the abode of intelligent
life. Despite his epoch-making work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
with Darwin, nearly fifty years ago, which must
forever merit our gratitude, and the charm of his
various essays on protective coloring, mimicry,
theory of birds' nests, etc., he has since those
lucid days expressed convictions of such a nature
that if a future DeMorgan should write on human
paradoxes he would classify Mr. Wallace as
chief among them. A profound believer in evolution,
he exempts man from the inexorable logic
of the principle with about as much reason as
if, confessing his belief in the nebular hypothesis,
he should insist that the Earth was an exception.</p>

<p>But to return to Professor Newcomb's recent
utterances. In the above-mentioned article he
says: "Not only does life, but intelligence,
flourish on this globe under great variety of conditions
as regards temperature and surroundings,
and no sound reason can be shown why, under
certain conditions which are frequent in the
universe, intelligent beings should not acquire
the highest development." Again he says:
"Life, not wholly unlike that on the Earth, may
therefore exist upon Mars, for anything we know
to the contrary. More than this we cannot say."
In his final summing up Professor Newcomb says:
"It is therefore perfectly reasonable to suppose
that beings not only animated but endowed with
reason inhabit countless worlds in space."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
It would seem as if a mind capable of entertaining
an idea of our uniqueness in the universe
betrays the survival of a mental condition which,
centuries ago, regarded the stars as bits of luminous
material expressly designed to illuminate
this little earth, around which they all pursued
their daily paths.</p>

<p>In a discussion of the surface markings of
Mars a broad sketch of what has already been
accomplished in the study of that planet should
be given for the general reader. I know of no
better way of doing this than by giving a brief
abstract of Percival Lowell's epoch-making work
entitled "Mars." In this book he presents in a
clear and striking manner the results of his own
work covering continuous observations of the
planet for many years. The preface is dated
from Flagstaff, Arizona, 1895. Since that time
he has issued three volumes of Memoirs, in quarto,
of the Lowell Observatory, and a number of
Bulletins in which he presents many additional
facts confirming previous observations, besides
new observations; and finally, in a late Bulletin,
he has presented photographs of Mars made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
his assistant, Mr. Lampland, in which a number
of canals plainly show, thus setting forever at
rest the question of the subjective character of
the markings. The student must, however, follow
the advice of an English reviewer and by
all means read the book.</p>

<p>"To determine," says Mr. Lowell, "whether
a planet be the abode of life in the least resembling
that with which we are acquainted, two
questions about it must be answered in turn:
first, are its physical conditions such as render
it, in our general sense, habitable; and secondly,
are there any signs of its actual habitation?
These problems must be attacked in their order,
for unless we can answer the first satisfactorily,
it were largely futile to seek for evidence of the
second." The reason why Mars in certain years
becomes so conspicuous is that its orbit is highly
eccentric. Every two years&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the period of its
revolution about the Sun&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;brings it nearest to
the Sun, and once in fifteen years we find ourselves
between it and the Sun at its nearest approach.</p>

<p>Huyghens, in 1659, made a drawing of the
dark region on Mars now known as the Syrtis
Major, and, through its disappearance and reappearance,
he discovered that the planet rotated
on its axis, and roughly determined a daily
period of twenty-four hours. For the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
it was known that Mars had a day and a night.
As some doubts existed as to the correctness of
Huyghens's figures, Cassini in 1666 determined
anew the rotation period of Mars and found it to
be twenty-four hours and forty minutes. From
the white polar caps, the study of which we first
owe to Maraldi, it was found that the tilt of its
axis to the plane of its orbit was very nearly the
same as that of the Earth. As this inclination
determines the seasons, it was seen that Mars,
like the Earth, had its spring, summer, autumn,
and winter. A polar flattening was also observed
which was slightly in excess of ours.</p>

<p>"To all forms of life of which we have any
conception, two things in Nature are vital, air and
water." Has it an atmosphere? Without air
no change could take place. The Moon without
air remains unchanged, except what gravitation
accomplishes in pulling down crater walls.
"With Mars it is otherwise. Over the surface
of that planet changes do occur, changes upon a
scale vast enough to be visible from the Earth."
The first sign of change occurs in the polar snow
cap. It dwindles in size every two years (the
time of a single revolution of Mars around the
sun). For nearly two hundred years these white
polar caps have been observed to wax and wane.
As the Martian winter comes on in the northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
hemisphere, for example, the polar cap extends
its borders to the temperate zone. As summer
comes on the snow cap is seen to dwindle gradually
away, till by early autumn it presents
but a tiny patch a few hundred miles across.
Schiaparelli observed changes in tint which
he noticed were correlated with the seasons. In
1894 observations were made continuously from
early June till late in November. These dates,
in Mars, represent the last of April till the last
of August. During this time marked changes
took place in the bluish-green areas of the
planet. A wave of seasonal change swept down
from the pole to the equator. The fact of this
occurrence constitutes positive proof of the presence
of an atmosphere. In another way the
evidence was shown. A series of measurements
of the polar and equatorial diameters of Mars
were made, and these indicated that a visible
layer of twilight atmosphere had been measured.
This, Lowell explains by a diagram and other
data. It is found, according to Lowell's observations,
that the atmosphere is much freer from
clouds than had been supposed. He shows conclusively
that it is much rarer than that of the
Earth. Appearances have been seen, however,
which are best explained by assuming them to
be clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
During the opposition of 1892, Mr. Douglass,
at that time an assistant astronomer at the
Lowell Observatory, made a special study of the
terminator of <span class="locked">Mars.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> A careful study of the terminator
for almost every degree of latitude was
made, and 733 irregularities were detected. Of
this large number, 694 were not only recorded,
but measured; and of these, 403 were depressions,
and 291 were elevations of the surface.
Many of these irregularities were supposed to be
clouds, but the arguments to support this attribution
are too technical to be presented here.
Unmistakable clouds have also been seen moving
at a definite rate of speed, as if carried along
by the wind.</p>

<p>"To sum up, now, what we know about the
atmosphere of Mars: we have proof positive
that Mars has an atmosphere; we have reason
to believe this atmosphere to be very thin,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;thinner
at least by half than the air upon the
summit of the Himalayas,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and in constitution,
not to differ greatly from our own."</p>

<p>As to the existence of water on the planet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
one has only to consider the polar snow caps.
In the height of the southern winter, the polar
cap of snow measures over two thousand miles
across, covering fifty-five degrees of latitude,
with one unbroken waste of white. As spring
advances the snow begins to melt, disappearing
rapidly as summer comes on, and, as it melts, a
dark band is seen bordering this edge. As the
snow recedes the dark band recedes. This band
is, therefore, not a permanent marking on the
planet, but obviously water, the result of the
melting snow&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;an arctic sea, in fact. This band
is irregular, varying in width in different longitudes,
as if the water filled up large areas of
depression. When finally the snow cap disappears,
as it did for the first time on record on
the notable occasion of October 13, 1894, the dark
band, which had become thinner, disappeared
also, leaving only a yellow stretch of surface.
An additional proof that this dark band is water,
was established by Professor W.&nbsp;H. Pickering,
for he discovered that the light reflected from
its surface was polarized. The absurdity of the
suggestion that these white polar caps are not
snow, but congealed carbonic acid gas, is fully
shown by Lowell.</p>

<p>The asymmetry of the outline of these snow
caps is paralleled by the irregularity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Earth's polar caps. Glints of brilliant light are
seen to flash out from this region, as if produced
by sunlight reflected from a sloping surface.
On comparing these flashes of light with observations
made by Green, in 1877, they were
found to be in the same place. Detached fields
of snow were also observed below the receding
line, an evidence that these regions were at a
higher elevation. As before stated, on October
13, 1894, for the first time in the record of
polar observations, the southern polar cap disappeared
entirely. In this connection it may be
of interest to observe that in the United States,
in the summer of 1894, the temperature ranged
a few degrees above the normal. (For this fact
I am indebted to Professor Cleveland Abbe,
E.&nbsp;S. M.)</p>

<p>The large, irregular, dark regions on the
planet have been supposed to be bodies of
water, or seas, and have been described and
named as such by astronomers. Lowell shows,
however, that there is every reason to doubt this
conclusion. "To begin with, they are of every
grade of tint,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a very curious feature for seas
to exhibit, unless they were everywhere but a
few feet deep; which, again, is a most singular
characteristic for seas that cover hundreds of
thousands of square miles in extent,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;seas, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
is, as large as the Bay of Bengal. The Martian
surface would have to be amazingly flat for this
to be possible. We know it to be relatively flat,
but to be as flat as all this would seem to pass
the bounds of credible simplicity. Here, also,
Professor W.&nbsp;H. Pickering's polariscope investigations
come in with effect, for he found the
light from the supposed seas to show no trace
of polarization. Hence, these were probably not
water."</p>

<p>Lowell also shows that if these regions were
seas, or water surfaces of the shallowest kind,
sunlight would certainly be reflected from some
portion of the surface so as to be visible from
the Earth. A calculation of the region from
which such a beam of light might be reflected
has been carefully made, but no light of this
nature has ever been seen. These regions change
in color, and Schiaparelli suggested that in some
way these changes were dependent on the Martian
seasons. Lowell, by continuous observations
covering many presentations of the planet,
has demonstrated that the changes in color are
synchronous with the seasons, and they further
show that these regions change in expanse as
well. The reader must refer to Lowell's book
to understand the very minute way in which the
author traces out the behavior of these so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
seas as the Martian summer advances and
autumn comes on. His evidence is overwhelming
that the regions heretofore regarded as seas
are vast tracts of vegetation, doubtless on lower
levels, or depressions of the surface, old sea
bottoms, in fact, where springs and the natural
settlings of stray waters might keep the ground
sufficiently moist to support a scanty growth.
The regions not marked by the dark shading,
from their reddish and yellowish tinge, have
always been regarded as land, probably desert
land, as they remain fixed from year to year,
dead and unchangeable as deserts are.</p>

<p>The question naturally arises, if the water of
Mars is piled up at the poles as snow, how does
it find its way back on its melting? A discovery
made by Schiaparelli in 1877 revealed the
existence of various lines marking the surface
which he called <em>canali</em>, or <span class="locked">channels.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> These lines
cover the face of the planet like a net, they are
laid out with geodetic precision. "The lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
start from points on the coast of the blue-green
regions, commonly well-marked bays, and proceed
directly to what seem centres in the middle
of the continent, since, most surprisingly, they
meet there other lines that have come to the
same spot with apparently a like determinate
intent." In other words these lines&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;fine,
straight, dark, as if cut by an engraver, some
of them running for hundreds of miles&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;converge
at certain centres. They all start, as
Schiaparelli first observed, from definite regions
and terminate at definite points. Many of them
follow the arcs of great circles. These lines
may be thirty or more miles in width, apparently
preserving the same width throughout,
though slightly wider where they leave the dark
bands. They run in every direction, a number
often converging at a common centre, and, when
they do so, a round, dark area appears which
Lowell has called an oasis.</p>

<p>In the clear and steady atmosphere of Flagstaff,
Mr. Lowell, by the aid of his superb telescope,
has added about four times as many canals
as are shown on Schiaparelli's chart. These
canals form an intricate network of lines, and no
one can contemplate these curious features without
being impressed by their artificial character.
Schiaparelli, who first discovered them in 1877,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
continued his observations from year to year
despite the fact that no one else could see them.
In the course of a few years he discovered a still
more remarkable condition, and this was that a
number of the canals appeared double. This,
indeed, seemed an optical illusion, and by no
means strengthened his position, as the single
canals proclaimed by him were supposed to be
figments of the imagination. Undeterred by
the general scepticism, Schiaparelli established,
at each fresh opposition, his previous announcements.
For nine years no one was able to confirm
his marvellous discoveries. In the year 1886,
however, Perrotin, at Nice, with his assistant,
Thollon, managed to make out a number of the
canals, single and double, which were carefully
drawn. Reference to Perrotin's work will be
made further on. The reason why so few have
seen them is the lack of observers with acute
eyesight and patient devotion to the work,
coupled with unsteady air. Size of aperture
seems to be of little importance. That Schiaparelli,
with an 8-1/3 inch glass, discovered the
canals, while with the twenty-six inch glass of
the Naval Observatory at Washington they have
never been seen, is emphatic evidence of what a
clear and steady atmosphere means in the study
of delicate planetary markings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
The artificiality of the canals is shown by
the "supernaturally regular appearance of the
system, upon three distinct counts: first, the
straightness of the lines; second, their individually
uniform width; and, third, their systematic
radiation from special points." It was the mathematical
shape of the Ohio mounds that first
suggested their artificial character. That these
lines are artificial and not natural is seen in the
fact that at times they are not visible. The
lines while temporary in appearance are permanently
in place. "Not only do they not
change in position during one opposition; they
seem not to do so from one opposition to another."
"Unchangeable, apparently, in position,
the canals are otherwise among the most changeable
features of the Martian disk." The order of
their appearance synchronizes with the changes
of the season, as the snow caps begin to melt
the canals begin to appear; in appearance
strengthened first at the borders of the polar seas
and gradually stretching down towards the equator.
In minute detail Lowell presents the
successive visibility of the different canals. To
account for all these phenomena we have to
look at our own Earth for a parallel, and we
see it in the great irrigation tracks of the
West, and in the vast irrigated regions in India<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
depending upon the melting of the Himalaya
snow cap.</p>

<p>The accumulative evidence is overwhelming
that here is a dry planet, and an intelligence of
some kind that can only survive by utilizing the
few remaining sources of water supply. It is to
the merit of Professor W.&nbsp;H. Pickering, to whom
Professor Lowell gives the credit of having first
suggested the idea of irrigation to account for
the great width of the canals. What we see,
then, is not the canal, which may be a slender
stream of water, but a broad band of vegetation
irrigated from these narrow channels. These
lines penetrate and cross the dark regions in
various directions, which again offer additional
proof that the so-called seas are not seas but
areas of vegetation sparsely scattered, against
which the irrigated portions are of sufficient
strength and color to <span class="locked">show.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>
<p>Among the most interesting features of the
planet's surface are the round, or oval spots
which Lowell calls oases; these invariably occur
at the junction of the canals. "In spite of the
great number of the spots, not one of them
stands isolate. There is not a single instance of
a spot that is not connected by a canal to the
rest of the dark areas." There appears to be no
spot that has not two or more canals running to
it, and apparently no canal junction is without
its spot. The majority of the spots are 120 to
150 miles in diameter. There are many smaller
ones. These spots, like the canals, appear and
disappear coincidently with seasonal changes.
The canals and the oases follow the same method
and order in their growth. "Both are affected
by one progressive change that sweeps over the
face of the planet from the pole to the equator."
The reader cannot dwell too strongly on the fact
that the visibility of these various markings
appears first in northern latitudes, and gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
darkens toward the equator, precisely the reverse
of the unfolding of plant life on the Earth.
From Mars our Earth would show its tropical
vegetation the year round, while in Mars no
tropical vegetable coloration would appear until
water from the melting polar snow caps animates
its growth.</p>

<p>Lowell shows conclusively that the seas are
not seas, nor the canals waterways, nor the
spots lakes. Apparently, the spots appear not
so much by an increase in size as by a deepening
in tint. They start, it would seem, as big as
they are to be, but faint in tone; they then
proceed to darken throughout. If these spots
are areas of vegetation, the explanation of their
appearance is at once evident. Even more
markedly unnatural is another phenomenon of
this phenomenal system, of which almost every
one has heard and almost nobody has seen,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
double canals. Upon a part of the disk
where, up to that time, a single canal has been
visible, of a sudden, some night, in place of the
single canal, twin canals are perceived, similar
in character and inclination, absolutely parallel,
reminding one of the twin rails of a railroad
track. The regularity of the thing is startling.
In details the doubles vary, chiefly, it would
seem, in the distance the twin lines lie apart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Lowell says the widest he has seen is the
Ganges, in which six degrees separate the two
lines,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in the narrowest, the Phison, four degrees
and a quarter. From 120 to 175 miles of clear
country is found between the paralleling lines.
"One element of mystery may be eliminated at
the outset.... It is perceived of a sudden, by
the observer, because of some specially favorable
night. But it has been for some time developing.
So much is apparent from my observations.
Suggestions of duality occurred weeks before the
thing stood definitely revealed. Furthermore,
the gemination may lie concealed from the observer
some time after it is quite complete,
owing to lack of favorable atmospheric conditions.
For it takes emphatically steady air to
see it unmistakably." Each canal has its individual
behavior of doubling, and the varying
widths, and their evident seasonal relations
utterly forbid the conception that their appearance
is due to optical illusion. Mr. Lowell feels
tolerably sure that the doubling, or gemination
of the canals, show that the phenomenon is not
only seasonal but vegetal. Why it should take
this form is one of the most pregnant problems
about the planet. For it is the most artificial-looking
phenomenon of an artificial-looking
disk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
We quote a paragraph from the concluding
chapter in his book: "To review, now, the chain
of reasoning by which we have been led to
regard it probable that upon the surface of Mars
we see the effects of local intelligence. We find,
in the first place, that the broad physical conditions
of the planet are not antagonistic to some
form of life; secondly, that there is an apparent
dearth of water upon the planet's surface,
and, therefore, if beings of sufficient intelligence
inhabited it, they would have to resort to irrigation
to support life; thirdly, that there turns
out to be a network of markings covering the
disk, precisely counterparting what a system of
irrigation would look like; and, lastly, that
there is a set of spots placed where we should
expect to find the lands thus artificially fertilized,
and behaving as such constructed oases
should. All this, of course, may be a set of
coincidences, signifying nothing; but the probability
points the other way. As to details of
explanation, any we may adopt will undoubtedly
be found, on closer acquaintance, to vary from
the actual Martian state of things; for any Martian
life must differ markedly from our own."</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In this brief résumé of Lowell's work on Mars
but scant justice has been done to the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
novel and convincing suggestions in explanation
of the varied features marking the surface of
Mars. There are many enigmas, however,
awaiting solution, if we endeavor to explain
them by comparison with the methods pursued
by man on this Earth, and Mr. Lowell frankly
admits the many difficulties in the way of a
clear solution. I have already mentioned how
puzzling the checker-board appearance of our
Western townships would seem to a Martian,
but this comparison does not help us to understand
the so-called gemination of the canals,
though we might have parallel sets of canals,
as we have parallel lines of railways. The
enormous distance which the water travels in
the Martian canals must presuppose an artificial
method of urging it on. Precisely how this
operation might be accomplished is a question
to be solved by the mechanical and hydraulic
engineer.</p>

<p>Beside the doubling, or so-called gemination,
of the canals, there are other enigmas in the
markings. At certain times there has been observed
in the equatorial region of Mars a number
of white spots, which have greatly puzzled
the student of Mars and for which no explanation
has yet been offered. That they are not
clouds is seen in the fact that they do not move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
or drift. Furthermore these white spots are
fixed features of the region, as they appear in the
same places. It might be suggested that they
represent snow-capped elevations or mountain
peaks, but this is difficult to believe, as an examination
of the terminator of Mars reveals no
evidences of high elevations. These white spots
appear only in mid-summer, which would argue
against the idea of their being snow caps, as in
mid-summer they would certainly melt and disappear.
The time of their appearance coincides
with the time of greatest equatorial heat. For
a reasonable suggestion it might be offered that
these white spots are due to vegetation of some
kind. The cotton belt of the South, if one could
imagine the cotton bolls a little larger and more
crowded together, would make white areas.
Masses of white flowers, such as the whiteweed
or daisy, may be seen covering hundreds of acres
of meadow land in New England. I have
noticed from the tops of mountains in New
Hampshire, in July, extensive meadow lands resembling
fields of snow from the profusion of
white daisies. The blossoming of fruit trees in
the Santa Clara valley, California, whitens the
surface for miles. Since the appearance of these
white spots in Mars corresponds with the period
of greatest evaporation, it is conceivable that an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
intelligence in Mars might utilize the same
method which has been recently adopted in
Connecticut and Porto Rico in the raising of
tobacco; namely, to protect the fields with
white cotton cloth; or, as in Florida, where extensive
orange groves are covered with white
cloth to guard against sudden frost. That this
supposition has something to commend it may
be seen in the accompanying reproduction of a
photograph (Plate I), made in Porto Rico, of
tobacco plantations when the fields are covered
with white cloth supported on suitable frames.
This picture appeared in an article by Eugene P.
Lyle, Jr., on Porto Rico, in the January number
of "World's Work," to the publishers of which
we are indebted for the privilege of using it.</p>

<p>These various guesses may all be wrong, as,
after all, we are judging Mars from conditions
belonging to our own planet. This, however,
we are compelled to do, as we have no other
standards of comparison.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>In the following chapter are presented abstracts
from memoirs, communications, etc., of a
few among the many astronomers and observers
who have recognized the markings on the planet,
and, in many cases, have made drawings of them.
Before presenting these few brief records, I have
compiled, from Camille Flammarion's great work
on Mars, the names of those astronomers whose
drawings he reproduces in this monograph, for
such it is. A brief examination of Flammarion's
volume will give one an idea of the extent and
variety of work which has already been accomplished
in interpreting the surface features of
Mars, and the number of astronomers who have
made contributions to the subject.</p>

<p>Flammarion divides these observations into
three periods; the first, beginning with the rude
drawing of Fontana, in 1636, followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Huyghens, in 1659, Cassini, in 1666, and many
others up to Harding, in 1824. In this period
the drawings were rude, though a number of the
more conspicuous features were established, and
above all, the existence of what was interpreted
as snow in the white polar caps. Astronomically
many points were determined, such as an
approximation of the period of revolution, the
distance of Mars from the Sun, the diameter of
the planet, its mass, the inclination of its axis,
the eccentricity of its orbit, its period of
rotation, etc.</p>

<p>The second period begins with the remarkable
work of Beer and Mäedler, in 1830 and subsequent
years. To them belongs the honor of being
the first astronomers to make a chart of the
planet. An advance standard was set for future
studies, and the work which followed revealed
details in the surface markings never before
suspected. The second period, from 1830 to 1877,
includes the observations and drawings of Beer
and Mäedler, 1830; Sir John Herschel, 1830;
Galle, 1837; Warren de la Rue, 1856; Webb,
1856; Secchi, 1858; Liais, 1860; Schmidt, 1862;

Green, 1873; Trouvelot, 1873; Lohse, 1873;
Holden, 1875.</p>

<p>The third period extends from 1877 to 1892,
when Flammarion published his book. The
following drawings are given: Flammarion,
1877&ndash;88; Paul and Prosper Henry, 1877;
Neisten, 1877&ndash;79&ndash;81&ndash;88; Terby, 1877&ndash;79&ndash;88;

1890.</p>

<p>It is impossible to follow these various drawings
of Mars from the earliest ones of the first
period, many of little value, to the slow yet
certain advance as seen in the more detailed
drawings of the second period, without realizing
the gradual improvement of the telescope, coupled
with a greater number of observers endowed
with better eyesight and impelled by deeper
interest in the work. In the third period, culminating
with the great work of Schiaparelli,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
and confirmed by the remarkable observations of
Perrotin and Thollon, we see the results of still
more arduous devotion to the work; a great
advance in telescopes, with better definition, and,
in the case of the observations at Nice and
Milan, a steadier atmosphere through which to
observe. Flammarion brought his work up to
1892.</p>

<p>Lowell's work on Mars, though of a kind with
Schiaparelli, is, in every circumstance accompanying
it, so remarkable that we may well consider
the standard now set by him as the beginning
of another period; and this period will fix a
standard which will consist in securing observers
who, in the language of Sir David Gill, have a
special faculty, an inborn capacity, a delight in
the exercise of exceptional acuteness of eyesight
and natural dexterity, coupled with the gift of
imagination as to the true meaning of what they
observe. With this standard established, there
must also go a perfect telescope for definition,
mounted on an elevation a mile and a half or
more above the level of the sea, in a region of
the clearest and steadiest atmosphere in the
world.</p>

<p>One cannot help reflecting on these various
drawings presented in Flammarion's work, and
wondering what the results would have been if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
all these astronomers could have had telescopes
as incomparable as that at Flagstaff, perched on
some high mountain peak with a clear and
steady atmosphere continuous for weeks, and,
superadded to all these advantages, independent
fortunes to enable them to transport their telescopes
thousands of miles south when a favorable
opposition of Mars occurred at a low altitude.</p>

<p>The astronomers who have advanced certain
theories to explain the markings may be counted
as admitting their existence, whatever they may
be. Among the other astronomers to be referred
to are, first, those who admit the markings,
and have in all likelihood seen them; second,
those who have observed and made drawings of
the markings; and, third, those who have drawn
them and admit, or at least do not deny, their
artificiality.</p>

<p>Miss Agnes M. Clerke, an astronomical writer
of great merit, who has written a most lucid
and comprehensive "History of Astronomy in
the Nineteenth Century," says: "The canals of
Mars are an existent and permanent phenomenon."
Mr. Thomas Lindsay, of Toronto, read
some notes before the Astronomical Society of
that city in regard to the phenomenon of the
so-called doubling of the canals and the explanation
advanced that it was due to errors in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
focusing. "It had been stated by several English
observers that, by racking the eyepiece
within or without the focus, all the phenomena
might be produced." In the case of Mars, however,
he asks: "How is it possible that all the
observers had their telescopes unadjusted, and, if
any one had, would he not be immediately aware
of it?" Mr. Lindsay thought that the theory
was too obviously opposed to the simplest kind
of common sense to merit a moment's consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. John A. Patterson, in his Presidential
address before the Astronomical Society of Toronto,
in speaking of Mars, said the discoveries
rest on the bed rock of scientific evidence; and,
after speaking of the supposed spectroscopic evidence
that there was no atmosphere in Mars, refers
to the polar snow caps, their melting, and the
lines of vegetation that are supposed to mark
the margin of the canals, and he asks: "Is it possible
that all these may be consistent with no
vapor floating above the surface? Is it sound
philosophy to conclude that the condition of
things on our own little world gauges the
possibilities and relations that exist in our sister
world? Dame Nature does not turn out all her
products in one pattern."</p>

<p>Mr. Denning, in the "Astronomische Nachrichten,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
No. 3926, gives the result of his observations
on Mars in 1903. He says the canals,
without doubt, are objective features; changes in
the appearance of these markings he attributes
to vaporous condensations. One rotation period
of the planet satisfies the observation of all
the markings, thus proving them to be definite
features of the planet's surface rather than drifting
vapors such as are seen when observing
Jupiter and Saturn. In spite of these admissions
Mr. Denning, in 1905, while repeating his convictions
as to the objectivity of the canals, denied
their sharp outline. Of the ten canals he drew,
eight were discovered by Schiaparelli, and two
were discovered by Lowell. Denning observed
these lines with a ten inch reflector. Schiaparelli
compared them in sharpness to lines of a steel
engraving. It rests with the reader to judge who
is most likely to be correct in his description of
the character of the lines&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Mr. Denning with a
ten inch reflector, in a poor atmosphere, or Schiaparelli
and Lowell, with a twenty-six and a
twenty-four inch refractor, respectively, in a far
superior atmosphere.</p>

<p>Among the many who have seen and drawn
the canals comes first, of course, Professor Schiaparelli,
the discoverer of them. It is only necessary
to state here that he first detected these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
enigmatical markings, which he named <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i>,
in 1877. In the opposition of 1879, he not only
confirmed the discoveries of 1877, but added new
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i>, and for the first time saw the curious
process of doubling, or gemination.</p>

<p>Astronomers in various parts of the world
searched in vain for these markings, and despite
the exalted character and remarkable work of
the distinguished Italian in other lines of astronomic
research, it was feared that, in this instance,
Schiaparelli had been the victim of an hallucination.
It is true that from the time of Huyghens,
in 1659, a few astronomers, such as Secchi,
Schroeter, Kaiser, and Dawes, have detected and
drawn a few faint lines which seemed to be
identical with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i> of Schiaparelli. It was
not until 1886, however, that Perrotin and
Thollon with a twenty-nine inch refractor of the
Nice Observatory, first began to confirm the
discoveries of Schiaparelli, and since that time
observers in various parts of the world have
detected and drawn these remarkable lines. The
cumulative testimony of these men as to the
veritable existence of these markings cannot be
set aside.</p>

<p>It seems strange that nine years should elapse
before an astronomer with an interest in the
subject, coupled with an acute vision and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
patience to observe assiduously, should arise to
confirm the existence of these markings, but in
another chapter I have called attention to the
little interest astronomers have manifested in
planetary markings of any kind. It has been
shown elsewhere that acute vision, with a clear
and, above all, a steady atmosphere, are the chief
essentials in making out the markings. It is
curious to note the attitude of some astronomers,
who, having seen the canals and even drawn
them, denied their veritability. Their explanations
cover "illusions due to the property of light
itself, the inability of the eye to maintain its
mechanism of accommodation, the behavior of air
waves, temporary alteration of the focus of the
eye, undetected astigmatism," etc., etc. But, to
return to the astronomers who have drawn them.
On the unfavorable opposition of 1888, Schiaparelli
declares that "the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i> had all the
distinctness of an engraving on steel, with the
magical beauty of a colored engraving." He
furthermore says: "As far as we have been able
to observe them hitherto, they are certainly fixed
configurations upon the planet, the Nilosyrtis has
been seen in that place for nearly one hundred
years and some of the others for at least thirty
years."</p>

<p>In this connection it is interesting to quote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
from Schiaparelli who, until many years after
he discovered the canals of Mars, had no doubt
of their natural origin. As late as 1893, he still
considered them natural. In speaking of the
canals, he says: "It is not necessary to suppose
here the work of intelligent beings; and in
spite of the almost geometric appearance of
their whole system, for the present we incline to
believe that they are product of the evolution of
a planet, much as on the Earth is the English
Channel, or the Channel of Mozambique." This
extract may be found in a memoir in "Natura
ed Arte," 1893, page 22. On page 24 of the
same memoir Schiaparelli illustrates the elasticity
of his mind and a thoroughly unprejudiced
attitude by saying: "Their singular aspect,
and the fact that they are drawn with absolute
geometric precision, as if they were the product
of rule and compass, have induced some people
to see in them the work of intelligent beings,
inhabitants of the planet. <em>I should be very
careful not to combat this supposition, which
involves no impossibility.</em>" (The italics are ours.)
His comparison of the Martian lines with the
English Channel and the Channel of Mozambique,
if he means any resemblance in form and not
in the manner of formation, is most unfortunate,
for on the whole face of the Earth he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
have mentioned surface features more totally
unlike any feature of the Martian surface, as
drawn by him, than these two channels: the
English Channel, 100 miles wide at its mouth
and 200 miles long, tapering to the Straits
of Dover; the Mozambique Channel, hour-glass
shaped, 1,100 miles long, and, at its narrowest
part, 260 miles wide, and at either end nearly
700 miles wide. Had he
suggested the Red Sea,
1,200 miles long, or the
Straits of Malacca, 350
miles long, a nearer resemblance
to the canals
of Mars might have been
seen, though even here
it would be impossible to
find their counterparts
in Mars. These channels are merging with the
ocean, are nearly half the width of their length,
and enlarge at both ends, while the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i> of
Mars run for hundreds of miles as straight as
ruled lines. How slight the resemblance is may
be appreciated by comparing the following figure
of the Earth (Fig. 1), upon which the Red Sea,
the English and the Mozambique Channels and
the Straits of Malacca are indicated.</p>

  <img src="images/i079.jpg" width="170" height="169" class="noborder" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="caption bold"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></div></div>

<p>In 1897 Schiaparelli becomes still more convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
of their artificiality. In his Memoir XXV,
in the Reale Academia del Lincei, in speaking of
the canals, he says: "This whole arrangement
presents an indescribable simplicity and symmetry
which cannot possibly be the work of chance."
In a letter to Mr. Lowell, dated December 4,
1904, he writes: "Your theory of vegetation
becomes more and more probable." Mr. A.
Stanley Williams, in the "Observatory" for
June, 1899, in a paper entitled "Notes on
Mars," described the appearance of certain
canals, regions, etc., in great detail. He notices
that at the crossing of the canals a little dark
spot occurs, a feature, he says, which was first
elucidated by Professor Lowell in 1894. Mr.
Williams also noticed the black streak bordering
the northern snow cap, which Mr. Lowell in his
book on Mars has interpreted as a body of water
resulting from the melting snow.</p>

<p>In the Quarterly Journal of the Astronomical
Society of Wales, the Rev. Theo. E.&nbsp;R.
Phillips publishes an excellent drawing of Mars
in color. In this drawing he shows a large
number of regions, a number of canals, and
other features which, he says, "came out with
the clearness and sharpness of an engraving,
and bore no resemblance to the 'diffused streaks'
or amorphous smudges one sees for the canals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
in imperfect seeing." In this drawing the polar
snow caps show with remarkable vividness.</p>

<p>Professor W.&nbsp;H. Pickering, in a continuous
record of observations on Mars, published in the
"Annals of the Lowell Observatory," records
under August 20: "The dark north canals are
also noticeable, and, had they looked as they
now do, could not possibly have been missed on
the 16th."</p>

<p>Dr. Phil. Fauth has, with a seven inch objective,
drawn and published sixty-three drawings of
Mars in which a great many canals are shown,
a list of which he presents in his memoir on the
subject.</p>

<p>The lamented Perrotin, for some time Director
of the Nice Observatory, in company with
M. Janssen, at Meudon, observed Mars through
the great equatorial (32-2/3 inch), and published
the results in the "Comptes Rendues" (Vol.
CXXIV, No. 7). He describes the several zones,
the northern equatorial zone "being more particularly
the zone of the extraordinary canals,
the discovery of which we owe to Schiaparelli,
and to which we ourselves, by our publication,
in 1886, called the attention of the astronomical
world."</p>

<p>The London "Nature," March 17, 1904, in
noting the death of M. Henry Perrotin, speaks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
him as one of the ablest advocates of astronomical
science. He devoted much time to Mars.
"Aware that he was working at the extreme
limit of visibility, and knowing the tendency for
self-deception to creep in and impair the value
of such delicate observations, he sought opportunities
of making similar measures and records
with different instruments, and under varied
conditions, in order to remove, so far as possible,
the evils of bias and partiality from the results
of his researches."</p>

<p>Dr. Terby of Louvain, in a memoir entitled
"Physical Observations of Mars," a translation of
which appeared in the "Astronomical and Astrophysical
Journal," No. 106, identifies many of
Schiaparelli's <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i> and other details depicted
in Schiaparelli's map of Mars. In conclusion
Dr. Terby says: "After what we have seen we
dare affirm that henceforth the progress of areography
will be in the hands of those alone who,
freeing themselves from the shackles of doubt,
will resolutely engage in the way traced by the
celebrated astronomer of Milan. A new era has
begun in the study of Mars by the discovery of
canals and their doubling, and by the micrometric
determination of one hundred and fourteen
fundamental points on the map, an era
succeeding to that which was inaugurated a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
century ago by the construction of the first two
hemispheres and by the approximate fixing of
fourteen points by Mäedler." Dr. Terby further
says: "But these results have an incontestable
value in the presence of the incredulity with
which certain astronomers still consider the
beautiful discoveries of Milan. Who would
believe it? In spite of the beautiful drawings of
M. Perrotin one reads still that the discoveries
of M. Schiaparelli have not been confirmed by
the largest instruments."</p>

<p>In "Astronomy and Astrophysics," No. 108,
is published a series of contributions on Mars by
Professors Edward C. Holden, William H. Pickering,
C.&nbsp;A. Young, Lewis Swift, George C.
Comstock, E.&nbsp;E. Barnard, and H.&nbsp;C. Wilson.
All of these men are astronomers and all are
connected as directors or observers with various
observatories in the United States. Many sent
sketches, most of them saw the canals, all saw
the polar snow caps and darker regions. To
say that these astronomers were sketching details
which existed only in their imagination is
simply preposterous.</p>

<p>Professor Herbert A. Howe, Director of the
Chamberlin Observatory, at Denver, in his "Elements
of Descriptive Astronomy" says: "If we
have simply to answer the question, 'Would a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
man, as constituted at present, if transported to
Mars find it possible to exist there?' The most
probable answer is, 'No.' While one must not
be dogmatic, it may be said, with some assurance,
that the man would gasp a few times and
die. However, it is conceivable that manlike
beings might find a home there." Mr. Howe
could have said without being dogmatic that a
man thus transported would die of what is
known as Caisson disease.</p>

<p>Among those who assert that the canals are artificial
we have Professor Percival Lowell as pre-eminent.
He has erected an observatory in the
region of one of the clearest atmospheres in the
world, has furnished it with the finest telescope
that Clark ever made, and for the chief purpose
of studying the surface features of Mars. In his
interesting book on Mars he has presented the
results of his observations in so lucid and convincing
a manner that a reviewer of the English
edition of the work, in an English astronomical
journal, is led to write: "We may say at once
that we feel bound to accept these observations
as sufficient evidence of the real existence of the
markings without expressing an opinion as to
what they may be." The reviewer ends by
saying: "Indeed, there is a subtle deftness in
the way Mr. Lowell deals with his observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
which gives the impression that he has been
there and seen it all, and it is really hard to say
why we cannot accept his conclusions. It is
probable, because we are shy to receive new facts
at a first statement. In time, no doubt, we
shall be willing to accept his deductions (or
facts) as to the markings. We were about to
advance objections, but they seem poor, and
really it is a case where each person must read
and form his own ideas&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;but by all means
read."</p>

<p>We have already presented a summary of his
observations. We may add here, however, an
extract from his book on the solar system. In
this Mr. Lowell says of Mars: "What we see
hints of the existence of beings who are in advance
of, not behind us in the journey of life,"
and again: "Life on Mars must take on a very
different guise from what it wears on the Earth.
It is certain there can be no man there&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that is
as certain as anything can be. But this does
not preclude a local intelligence equal to, and
perhaps easily superior to, our own. We seem to
have evidence that something of the sort does
exist there at the present moment and has made
imprint of its existence far exceeding anything
we have left on Mother Earth."</p>

<p>George W. Morehouse, in his "Wilderness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Worlds," says: "Taken all together we must
regard Mars as probably an inhabited world and
very similar to the Earth."</p>

<p>Mr. Hector Macpherson, Jr., member of the
Astronomical Society of France, in his interesting
book "Astronomers of To-day," says, in regard
to Mr. Lowell's book on Mars: "He does
not ask us to believe anything fantastical or
extravagant. His hypothesis has been framed to
account for all the various Martian features.
At present we can only say that it is the most
comprehensive and probable theory yet advanced
to explain the phenomena of the red planet."</p>

<p>Professor Todd, Director of the Astronomical
Observatory at Amherst College, in his book on
Stars and Telescopes, in referring to drawings of
a region in the southern portion of Mars, known
as the Solis Lacus, and a complicated drawing of
another region, says: "Whether one views this
marvellous and intricate system as a whole, or in
some portion of high detail, it is difficult to
escape the conviction that the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i> have, at
least in part, been designed and executed with a
definite end in view."</p>

<p>There are many who do not deny the existence
of some forms of life on the planet, but are not
prepared to admit the existence of intelligent
creatures. Sir Robert Ball expresses himself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
follows: "That there may be types of life of
some kind on Mars is, I should think, quite
likely."</p>

<p>The number of astronomers above quoted, who
have seen and drawn the canals, might be
augmented, but a sufficient number have been
cited to show that the evidence of the presence
of these markings does not rest with a few,
furthermore, some of these observers can only
interpret the markings as the result of intelligent
action. It may be urged that among those
quoted are some whose opinion may not have
great weight since they are not professional
astronomers. One must insist that the study of
planetary markings as well as the interpretation
of their meanings comes not only within the
province of planetary astronomers, but that any
broad-minded man, with an acute eye and familiar
with the sciences connected with the surface
features of the Earth, is quite competent to make
observations of his own and to judge of the
merits of the question.</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="smcap">Schiaparelli.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is a question whether, after all, the study
of planetary markings comes within the province
of astronomers. Not more, perhaps, than the
study of physical geography and subjects connected
with the surface features of the Earth,
comes under the cognizance of those whose
profession it is to determine the oscillation of the
pole, the Earth's movements due to the Moon,
etc. Indeed, these lines of research are strictly
astronomical. With the study of the surface
markings of the Moon, or Mars, features of an
entirely different kind are to be interpreted, and
quite a different equipment is necessary. It is
no wonder, then, that astronomers, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
conservative of all classes of investigators, should
view with suspicion the results of the work of
Schiaparelli, Lowell and others. Immersed in
mathematics, trusting in nothing that cannot be
measured and reckoned, as a class holding their
imagination in abeyance, is it any surprise that
they should present an attitude of indifference
and even hostility to the work of those who,
differently equipped mentally, have attempted
a definition and solution of the riddle of the
Martian markings? To appreciate how foreign
to the studies of an astronomer is the interpretation
of the canals of Mars, one has simply to
scan the index of any astronomical publication,
or the titles of papers in the transactions of
astronomical societies. For example, take volumes
XX and XXI of the "Astronomical Journal"
and tabulate the papers, memoirs, etc., therein
published, numbering two hundred and thirty-eight,
and we find of these, seventy-four on the
stars; sixty-two on the comets; nineteen on
planets and satellites, mostly mathematical;
eighteen on the Sun; eighteen on the asteroids;
fifteen on Eros; ten on polar motion and latitude;
four on Nova Persei; and seventeen miscellaneous,
consisting of logarithms, instruments,
Gegenschein, etc.; and only one on Mars, and this
on the polar snow caps!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
As to the question whether it is more important
to add another to the thousands of variable
stars and binaries, and hundreds of asteroids,
already determined, or to consider whether we
are alone in the universe and, if so, the significance
of it, I think with the intelligent public
there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>A fair sample of the subjects which occupy
the astronomers' mind, and which are so remote
from the study of planetary markings, and have
so little interest for the public, may be gathered
from the following list selected at random from
an astronomical publication. Notes on variable
stars; Maxima and minima of long period variables;
Micrometrical measurements of the companion
of Procyon; The problem of three bodies;
Ephemeris of Comet a, 1901; On the eruptive
energy of the stars; Eclipse cycles; Determinations
of the aberration-constant from right ascension;
Theory of a resisting medium upon
bodies moving in parabolic orbits; Weights and
systematic corrections of meridian observation in
right ascension and declination; and other titles
equally profound. Many of these memoirs consist
of hundreds of pages of figures, and, as a
friend of mine observed, not a column footed
up! Take for example a title like the following:
"Method of developing the perturbative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
functions, also precepts for executing their development."
This memoir is accompanied by
pages of algebraic formulæ which the layman
turns over in despair, the only illumination consisting
of a few words in English which render
the gloom still more apparent,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;such words as
"hence," "or," "we therefore have," "if we
put." Of what we "have," and why we "put,"
we are left in profound ignorance. Now I venture
to believe that the great world of humanity
takes but little interest in such pages, or in the
kinds of titles above given, though fully realizing
that they mean something and represent important
steps in astronomic research. It would add
greatly to the value of these contributions if a
brief summary in plain English could be given
at the end of these papers, but it is the rarest
event that these collectors of data ever make
any generalizations, or form any deductions.</p>

<p>My faith in the appalling character of algebraic
formulæ<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> received a rude shock when I
learned of an experience of Louise Michel, the
anarchist, who was transported for life to New
Caledonia (afterwards pardoned). On arriving
at the savage island, true to her humanitarian
instincts, "she immediately established a school
for native children, who by a curious freak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
of their minds, she noted with rejoicing,
took naturally to algebra before they learned
arithmetic!"</p>

<p>Hovenden quotes Huxley as saying that
mathematics "is that study that knows nothing
of observation, nothing of induction, nothing of
experiment, nothing of causation." He also
quotes the words of Clerk Maxwell, who said, in
regard to mathematicians, that it was "doubtful
whether the ideas as expressed in symbols had
ever quite found their way out of the equations
into their minds." They never seem to appeal
to the doctrine of probabilities nor do they in
any way permit imagination to act as a stimulus
to suggestive thought.</p>

<p>Least of all would a layman ridicule or question
the painstaking labor involved in astronomic
work, though he cannot see a glimmer of
light or intelligence in the enigmatical pages.
A certain class of astronomers might take a
lesson from an intelligent public in ceasing to
scoff and ridicule what they are unable to see
themselves in the Martian markings. The chief
work of these men indicates the cold precise
measuring of points of light in the heavens, the
determination of orbits, elements and ephemeris
of heavenly bodies, the determination of solar
parallax, etc., most of the subjects strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
mathematical, a question of careful measurements
for which the necessary instruments are
at hand, or simply sweeping the heavens for a
new variable, binary or asteroid. Parallaxes and
orbits are matters of measurement to be reckoned
by the figures of anybody else. It is obvious
from all this that little or no interest is manifested
by astronomers in planetary markings,
least of all in those of Mars. The exasperating
feature of the matter is that they persistently
repudiate the observation of others equally well
equipped, and endowed with the same enthusiasm
and devotion to their work.</p>

<p>The way in which the gatherers of the raw
material arrogate to themselves the science of
astronomy, relegating the thinkers and generalizers
to the limbo of speculation, is as if the
book-keepers of a corporation should assume
themselves to be the master-minds of the concern
and the banker, or financier, at the head of
it, a dreamer not worth regarding.</p>

<p>An illustration of the conservativeness of
astronomers in regard to planetary markings is
shown in their cautious attitude concerning the
polar snow caps of Mars. Here are white polar
caps on Mars, precisely where they ought to be
if they <em>are</em> snow, they wax and wane at the time
they should and at no other time, a dark band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
appears at their borders as the caps in turn
diminish in size, which has been interpreted as
water due to the melting snow, and no other
substance known could possibly reproduce these
varying conditions. Professor C.&nbsp;A. Young, in
describing these white areas, says: "The one
which happens to be turned toward the Sun
continually diminishes in size, while the other
increases, the process being reversed with the
seasons of the planet." After these admissions
Professor Young cautiously says: "These are
believed to be ice caps." Sir John Herschel
says: "The variety in the spots may arise from
the planet not being destitute of atmosphere and
clouds, and what adds greatly to the probability
of this is the appearance of brilliant white spots
at the poles&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;one of which appears in our
figure&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which have been conjectured with some
probability to be snow, as they disappear when
they have been long exposed to the Sun, and are
greatest when just emerging from the long
night of the polar winter." Had Michael Faraday
been an astronomer, how long would it have
taken him to pronounce these white polar caps
snow and ice? De la Rive, in his memoir of
Faraday, in speaking of his marvellous accomplishments,
says: "One may easily understand what
must be produced under such circumstances by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
life thus wholly consecrated to science, when to
a strong and vigorous intellect is joined a most
brilliant imagination." Tyndall, in his discourse
"On the Scientific use of the Imagination,"
says: "Bounded and conditioned by co-operant
reason, imagination becomes the mightiest instrument
of the physical discoverer. Newton's
passage from a falling apple to a falling Moon
was a leap of the imagination."</p>

<p>That Herbert Hall Turner, Professor of Astronomy
in the University of Oxford, does not
regard the various contributions on the surface
features of Mars as belonging to astronomical
science may be inferred from his interesting
book lately published, entitled "Astronomical
Discovery." This book presents to us the history
of the discovery of Uranus and Eros, of Neptune,
Bradley's aberration of light, Schwabe and sun-spot
period, the variation of latitude, etc., but
not a word about the marvellous discoveries of
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i> of Mars by Schiaparelli, so fully confirmed
by the observation and drawings of many
others, and the great advances made by Lowell
in the discovery of new features with his
lucid and rational interpretation of the seeming
enigmas.</p>

<p>Astronomy, the oldest and most conservative
of all the sciences, has been the last to subdivide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Already one group of men has justified by its
work a division of the science known as astrophysics.
The lamented Keeler, in explaining
the difference between astronomy and astrophysics,
said: "Astrophysics seeks to ascertain
the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than
their positions and motions in space, <em>what</em> they
are, rather than <em>where</em> they are." This natural
division suggests the propriety of making another
division equally distinct, which should comprise
the study and interpretation of the surface markings
of the planets and satellites, under the name
of planetology. The study would be the application
to these bodies of the science of geology,
in its broadest sense, meteorology, physical geography,
geodesy, and related sciences.</p>

<p>With the science of planetology established,
the student of this science will no longer call to
his aid the astronomer, and, least of all, the
astrophysicist, nor will he be mindful of their
criticism or neglect. He will appeal to the
sciences which are involved in the study of the
surface features of his own globe, in the interpretation
of planetary detail.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>For years I had been familiar with different
representations of Mars in which the surface
features had been strongly depicted in black
and white; in other words, photo-reliefs, or
engravings incorporated with the printed page.
I had unwittingly come to believe that these
features were equally distinct when one observed
Mars through the telescope. I had not then
seen Schiaparelli's original memoir in which his
wonderful map presents the canals in light and
tenuous lines, which are, however, as clear cut
as the lines of a steel engraving, to use his
words. For a long time I had hoped for a
chance to observe Mars through a large telescope
in a clear and steady atmosphere. It seemed
reasonable to me&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;knowing nothing about it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that
one who had traced out under the microscope
delicate lines and structural features in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
diaphanous membranes, who had, in fact, used a
microscope with high powers for forty years,
would find it child's play to make out the canals,
oases, regions, etc., of Mars, as represented in the
various publications on the subject. Professor
Percival Lowell, of Flagstaff, Arizona, finally
gave me the opportunity I so much desired, and,
through his courtesy and kindness, I was enabled
to observe Mars every night for nearly six weeks
through his twenty-four inch refractor, the last
and probably the best telescope ever made
by Clark, mounted in one of the steadiest
atmospheres in the world and at an altitude
above sea-level of over 7,000 feet. Imagine my
surprise and chagrin when I first saw the
beautiful disk of Mars through this superb telescope.
Not a line! not a marking! The object
I saw could only be compared in appearance to
the open mouth of a crucible filled with molten
gold. Slight discolorations here and there and
evanescent areas outlined for the tenth of a
second, but not a determinate line or spot to be
seen. Had I stopped that night, or even a week
later, I might have joined the ranks of certain
observers and said "illusion" or something
worse. And right here it was that my experience
in microscopic work helped me, for, remembering
the hours&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;nay, days&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I had worked, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
making out structural features in delicate organisms
which my unprofessional friends could
not see at all, I realized that patient observation
would be required if I was to be successful in my
efforts. My despair, however, was overwhelming
when Professor Lowell and his assistants, looking
for a few moments at the same object, would
draw on paper the features which had been
plainly revealed to them, consisting of definite
shaded regions, a number of canals and other
markings, of which, with the utmost scrutiny, I
could hardly detect a trace. For the first time
I realized that observing fixed diaphanous membranes
under a microscope with rigid stand, and
within four inches of one's nose, was quite a
different matter from observing a brilliant disk
4,200 miles in diameter, 52,000,000 miles away,
with an oscillating atmosphere of unknown depth
between. Night after night I examined this
golden, opalescent disk, drawing each time such
features as I could convey by memory from the
ocular to the drawing table, and, little by little,
new features were detected, and to my delight
the drawings agreed with those made by the
others. Since the drawings made by the four observers
coincided, it was evident that we had not
been victims of subjective phenomena. Furthermore,
as I discovered afterwards, by comparison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the drawings I made not only agreed with theirs
but with those made by other observers, at different
times, in other parts of the world. So
slow were my acquisitions, however, that it soon
became evident that at least months of continuous
observation would be necessary before the
more delicate markings would be revealed to me.
It is interesting to learn that others have had
a similar experience. Mr. A. Stanley Williams,
of England, in an article entitled "Notes on
Mars" ("Observatory," June, 1899), in stating
the difficulties of observation, says: "My eye
invariably requires at least two months of continuous
observation of a planet before it acquires
its full sensitiveness to the most minute details."</p>

<p>In this connection it is well to state that Mr.
Lowell began the observation of Mars when he
was a mere boy. His first telescope, which he
still has, was a two and a quarter inch refractor.
His observations were made from the roof of his
house in Boston, and with this small glass he
defined the general shaded regions that Huyghens
had detected and drawn in 1659. Since then
Mr. Lowell has observed in turn through a six
inch, an eighteen inch of Brashear, and, for the
last few years, through a twenty-four inch
refractor made by Clark especially for this work.</p>

<p>To refute the accumulated observations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Mr. Lowell one must have the same acute eye,
and a record of the same continuous and devoted
study. Nothing short of that experience will
avail. The jealous derision that has gone up
from some observers endowed with less acuteness
of vision is neither dignified nor just. Were
these Martian details based upon the observations
of Lowell alone, one might be inclined to
say that some vagary of the mind had led him
to imagine these markings which were first detected
by the great Italian astronomer Schiaparelli.
Up to the present time&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to mention only
a few&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;observations and drawings have been
made by Perrotin, Thollon, and Flammarion, of
France; Dr. Phil. Fauth, of Germany; Williams,
of England; Lowell, W.&nbsp;H. Pickering, Douglass,
Lampland, and Schaeberle, of America, while many
others have made drawings of the more conspicuous
details. With this record it is impossible
to deny the existence of these markings essentially
as they are drawn.</p>

<p>The difficulty of seeing the more delicate
markings of the planet is unquestionable, and
an examination of astronomical literature, from
which we shall make numerous quotations,
indicates only too plainly the acuteness of vision,
and the time and care necessary to make competent
observations. Sir Robert Ball says, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
one of his recent works: "The detection of the
Martian features indicates one of the utmost
refinements of astronomical observations." Macpherson,
in his "Astronomers of To-day," thus
writes of Schiaparelli, "Professor Schiaparelli's
observations have been distinguished by his keen-sightedness
and care. He has taken every precaution
to avoid all disturbances resulting from
personal equation, and has found it well to adopt
the rule (which he here quotes) 'to abstain from
everything which could affect the nervous system,
from narcotics and alcohol, and especially from
the abuse of coffee, which I found to be exceedingly
prejudicial to the accuracy of observation.'"
What I might have accomplished in the way of
seeing had I followed the wise example of Schiaparelli
I do not know. A not too strict abstemiousness
in any of these matters, coupled with
long daily walks on the Mesa, with its fascinating
flora and fauna, found me in the observer's
chair every night, somewhat fatigued mentally
and physically.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Ball, in his "Popular Guide to the
Heavens," in describing the difficulty in making
out the more delicate markings of Mars, says:
"It should be understood that in the unsteady
air of England it is almost hopeless to expect
many of the finer details; not even in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
favorable climates are they to be seen always, or
all at once, and much training of the eye is required
before it is fit to decide for or against the
existence of these details on the verge of invisibility."
As another illustration, perhaps, of the
difficulties of seeing, Sir Robert, in the same
book, says: "Observers of Mars are divided into
two camps, those who see the canals, and those
who do not. The former are in the strong position
that they are perfectly sure that they see
what they represent in their drawings."</p>

<p>From the foregoing it must be evident that not
only are the finer markings on Mars most difficult
to see even under the best conditions but
that exceptional acuteness of vision, which few
possess, united with long practice, is necessary to
make out the tenuous lines which enclose the
field of Mars like a net. That Mr. Lowell has
had a long and continuous practice, covering
years, in observing Mars through the steadiest of
atmospheres and with a superb glass, is simply a
statement of fact. It may be said without fear
of contradiction that he has devoted more time
to the observation of Mars than all the other
observers combined. Has he then an exceptional
acuteness of sight, coupled with indefatigable
industry, in the pursuit of this quest to which he
is devoting his life and fortune? The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
instance will illustrate his marvellous eyesight.
We were walking along the shores of a lake
some miles from Flagstaff, the expanse of shore
left by the rapidly evaporating waters abounding
with thousands of very small black spiders running
hither and thither at our approach. I told
him of one I had just seen in which the abdomen
was covered with minute young spiders
which the mother was carrying about with her&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a
well-known habit of certain species. This
curious fact I had detected only while stooping
close to the ground in search of minute shells.
Mr. Lowell, while walking along, immediately
began scanning the ground for the trace of a
spider with minutely granulated abdomen, and
finally exclaimed: "There is one of them!"
On stooping down to examine the object it
proved to my astonishment to be a female carrying
its young in the way already described.
This incident revealed a remarkable acuteness of
vision to detect, while standing erect and walking,
this tiny spider among hundreds of others
of its species that were scampering away at our
approach.</p>

<p>Not only is acuteness of vision necessary to
one who is to study planetary markings, but of
importance also is a clear, and above all a steady
atmosphere; and, strange as it may appear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
telescopes of moderate size seem to be the instruments
with which the best work has been
done. It is also true in astronomy, as in warfare,
that it is not the biggest gun but the man
behind the gun that does the most efficient work.
As an evidence of the importance of steady atmosphere
Professor W.&nbsp;H. Pickering, in his observations
on the satellites of Jupiter, says his
work had two important bearings: "First, as
showing the relative importance of atmosphere
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">versus</i> aperture for delicate visual observations
of this sort. In the same category would be
included studies of planetary detail as distinguished
from the examination of very faint
objects. In other words, if an observer wishes
to study very faint stars he must have a large
telescope. If he wishes to study the neighboring
planets and brighter satellites he may use
a small telescope, but he must have a very good
atmosphere."</p>

<p>The importance of a clear and steady atmosphere,
for delicate observation, is known to all
astronomers. The rarity of such days, even in
our clear atmosphere so superior to that of
England, is not generally known. Forty years
ago Dr. Henry Draper, in an address entitled
"Are Other Worlds Inhabited?" in speaking of
Mars and the difficulties of seeing, said: "One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of the greatest obstacles to distinct vision is our
own atmosphere. Its currents and motions tend
to confuse the outlines of objects, and, according
to my experience, a whole year may pass without
the occurrence of more than one good night.
The only remedy is to carry the telescope as high
up on a mountain as possible, so as to leave below
the more injurious portions of the atmosphere.
It might be possible to work 15,000 feet above
the sea in the neighborhood of the Equator." I
quote these words that the general reader may
appreciate the advantages Lowell has with his
fine telescope south of all European observatories,
in the latitude, say of Algiers, at a high
altitude, and in the dry and steady atmosphere
of Arizona, with uninterrupted seeing for weeks
together, and each night far superior to any
night which Greenwich could ever be blessed
with.</p>

<p>Professor W.&nbsp;H. Pickering attests to the importance
of a steady atmosphere in studying the
Moon from a station in Jamaica, when he says
that, with a five inch refractor, he was able to
detect minute details which were not revealed by
the far larger telescopes at Harvard University.</p>

<p>Mr. W.&nbsp;D. Barbour, President of the Leeds
Astronomical Society, using his four inch achromatic,
says: "In one of those brief intervals of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
atmospheric steadiness I saw distinctly a number
of well-known markings," the names of which
he gives. Dr. Phil. Fauth, using a seven inch
refractor, made sixty-three drawings of Mars,
showing in wonderful detail the canals, oases,
etc. Mr. W.&nbsp;J. Lockyer, in London "Nature,"
testifies that "a keen and patient observer,
sitting at the eyepiece of a comparatively small
equatorially mounted telescope, if he makes his
observations carefully, and with due regard to
atmospheric conditions for good seeing, can do
more useful and valuable work than one who
has a large aperture at his command and employs
it indifferently." Mr. E. Ledger, in speaking
of Dawes, who made a remarkable map of
Mars, says he was justly famed for the remarkable
distinctness of his vision; he had detected
and drawn a few lines which seemed to be
identical to those of Schiaparelli.</p>

<p>In the authorities above quoted we have
endeavored to show that a steady atmosphere,
a persistent devotion to the work, accompanied
by acute vision, and also a talent for observation,
are all the factors needed, not only to confirm
the remarkable discoveries of Schiaparelli and
Lowell, but possibly to detect, at favorable moments,
new features which have escaped the
eyes of these keen observers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
At this point we cannot resist giving the
words of Sir David Gill, Director of the Royal
Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. Professor
S.&nbsp;W. Burnham, of the Lick Observatory,
in reviewing a memoir entitled "Double Star
Observations at the Cape of Good Hope," quotes
as follows from the preface: "Sir David Gill,
in speaking of the routine character of the work
involved in the investigation, says: 'There is no
instance, as far as I know, of a long and valuable
series of double star discovery and observation
made by a mere assistant acting under
orders. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">It is a special faculty, an inborn capacity,
a delight in the exercise of exceptional
acuteness of eyesight and natural dexterity, coupled
with the gift of imagination as to the true meaning
of what he observes, that imparts to the
observer the requisite enthusiasm for double star
observing.</i> No amount of training or direction
could have created the Struves, a Dawes, or a
Dembowski. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">The great double star observer is born,
not made</i>, and I believe that no extensive series of
double star measurement will ever emanate from
a regular observatory, through successive directorates,
unless men are specially selected who have
previously distinguished themselves in that field
of work, and who were originally driven to it
from sheer compulsion of inborn taste.'" If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
the reader will substitute the words <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">planetary
markings</i> for <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">double star</i> in the above quotation
from Sir David Gill's report, he will understand
why we have ventured to italicise certain lines,
and will appreciate their significance. In no
stronger or truer words could one have emphasized
the conditions involved in a critical study
of the surface features of Mars.</p>

<p>In the experience of an astronomer, it is not
an unusual occurrence that an object in the
heavens, fairly conspicuous, remains unseen until
by some lucky chance an observer sweeping the
sky picks it up, and, having determined its
position, it is promptly found by others. Professor
H.&nbsp;H. Turner, in his "Astronomical Discovery
of the Nineteenth Century," says: "It is a common
experience in astronomy that an observer
may fail to notice in a general scrutiny, some
phenomenon which he can see perfectly well
when his attention is called to it; when a man
has made a discovery, and others are told what
to look for, they often see it so easily that they
are filled with amazement and chagrin that they
never saw it before."</p>

<p>In the Rev. T.&nbsp;W. Webb's interesting book on
"Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes," a
reminiscence of the author is given by a friend
in which the following is related as illustrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the varying ability of observers in seeing. "A
curious instance of difference of vision was well
illustrated one superb evening when Mr. Webb
and the writer were observing Saturn with the
nine and a half inch refractor at Hardwick.
Mr. Webb saw distinctly the division in the
outer ring which the writer could not see a
trace of, while the writer picked up a faint
point of light which afterwards turned out to
be Enceladus (a satellite) which Mr. Webb could
not see."</p>

<p>In my brief observation of Mars I probably
might have made out many more details if I
had permitted Mr. Lowell to tell me what to
see, and where to look for them on the disk.
This I would not allow him to do, nor did I study
any of the numerous drawings in his own work,
or the original memoirs of Schiaparelli, or other
works containing drawings of Mars in his
library. I would not learn the names of any of
the regions, or canals, nor with a single exception
do I know them now. Only when I had finished
my last night's observations, did Mr. Lowell take
my drawings and write out a list of the various
canals, oases, etc., which I had made out. Thus,
unaided, I drew simply what was plainly evident,
though many other details flashed out for a
second, which were not recorded, simply because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
I did not see them often enough to be sure of
their precise position on the disk.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell points out one of the reasons why
so many observers and astronomers have not
seen the canals. In the third volume of the
"Annals of the Lowell Observatory" he refers to
a certain series of observations of Mars, made in
1894, and says: "Not only was there no sign of
a canal, but even the main markings showed disheartingly
indefinite." "This vacancy of expression
was due to the Martian date." "It was
the very nick of time to see nothing, for the
part of the planet most presented to the Earth
was then at the height of the dead season, and
in this fact lies the key to much past undetection
and present unbelief in the phenomenon of the
canals."</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>Much doubt has been expressed as to the existence
of the so-called canals in Mars and other
surface markings of that planet in consequence
of the discrepancy seen in the drawings of the
more delicate features by various observers.
While in the main a certain general resemblance
is seen in the topographical character of the network
of lines, and a more close resemblance in
the darker markings, notably the Syrtis Major,
the disagreement in the minor details has led
certain astronomers to deny their existence altogether,
or to insist that most of the markings
were subjective, or due to poor focusing, or the
result of aberration of the eye or lens. Professor
Simon Newcomb, in his "New Astronomy
for Everybody," in speaking of the work of the
observers at the Lick Observatory and the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
telescope at their command coupled with favorable
situation, says: "It is therefore noteworthy
that the markings on the face of Mars as presented
by Barnard do not quite correspond to the
channels of Schiaparelli and Lowell." Newcomb
also reproduces in his book the drawings
of a region in Mars known as Solis Lacus, made
by Campbell and Hussey, and finds they do not
show an exact agreement between them. Now
such objections might have some weight if drawings
made by different observers of the Solar
Corona, for example, or the Nebula of Orion, or
the Milky Way had any close resemblance. As
a matter of fact, these various drawings depart
far more widely from the originals, as shown by
photographic reproduction, than do the various
drawings of Mars. Mr. Fison, in his "Recent
Advances in Astronomy," in speaking of the
divergence in the drawings made by different
observers, says: "In inspecting sketches of the
delicate details of the Corona of the Sun made at
the same place by different observers, it is difficult
to believe that the same object has been
represented." To appreciate how widely divergent
such drawings are one has only to refer to
the United States Naval Observatory publication
on the Total Eclipse of the Sun, July 29, 1878.</p>

<p>As an indication of the dissimilarity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
drawings of the Corona made at the same instant
by different observers, many of whom are well-known
astronomers, I may say that the various
plates resemble in turn the following objects: a
skate's egg-case; a circular battery discharging
fire from one side while the smoke drifts away
in the opposite direction; an ascidian, known as
Molgula, with an extra aperture, however; a
snowshoe; a radiolarian; a fighting shield of an
Igorrote savage; an egg of a hair worm; a
crushed spider, and other equally dissimilar objects.
I have reproduced a few of these drawings
(Plate II), that the reader may realize that
my similes are not exaggerated. The many
drawings which have been made of the Nebula
of Orion, by astronomers of distinction, depart
quite as widely from each other as do those of
the Solar Corona. In Volume XXV of the
"Naval Observatory Observations" is published
a monograph of the central parts of the Nebula
of Orion, by Professor E.&nbsp;S. Holden. He starts
with a drawing made by Huyghens in 1659 and
ends with a drawing made by Professor Langley
in 1879. In a summary of the work the author
says: "I am acquainted with but one drawing
of the Nebula which is entirely above criticism,
that of the late G.&nbsp;P. Bond. He was a skilled
artist," etc. An examination of the drawings in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
this Memoir are equally distracting. In looking
at them casually they suggest respectively a Japanese
stocking pattern; an amoeba; an embryo
cuttlefish; a plan of Boston, and other forms
equally divergent. Mr. Fison, in his book above
quoted, writes as follows of other astronomical
subjects: "Drawings of the Milky Way as seen
by the naked eye have been recently executed
by two independent observers, Mr. Boeddicker
and Mr. Eaton, each drawing the result of long
and arduous observation, but in comparing them
it is the exception rather than the rule to find
any approximation in agreement in respect of
the more delicate details." The drawings of the
surface features of Mars by different observers
do vary in respect of the more delicate details,
but in every case they represent a map of some
kind and do not remind one of a wheelbarrow,
baptismal font, or other incongruous objects.
These divergent drawings of the same object
are not confined to celestial bodies. One has
only to examine works on ancient Mexican and
Egyptian monuments, or those of classical archæology,
to see the astounding caricatures and perversions.
The various drawings of the famous
Dighton Rock inscription, covering a period of
two hundred years, are striking examples of the
vagaries of an artist. Moreover, the text accompanying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the drawings often states that they
were drawn with scrupulous care. The hieroglyphics
are pecked out on the face of a rock in
rough lines, half an inch wide and a third of an
inch in depth. These marks are in enduring
rock; it is the observer and his imperfect drawing
which is at fault. The Nebula of Orion, the
Milky Way, and, for the time being, the Solar
Corona are permanent objective realities and
have all been photographed, yet behold the
drawings! It is unnecessary to state that the
ability to draw varies quite as much with man
as the ability to sing. A man may be an excellent
observer and yet utterly unable to use a
pencil, and any attempt on the part of one to
draw who has no ability in that direction results
in a fiasco. It is noteworthy that an artist with
no knowledge of astronomy, or the art of telescopic
observation, will make a more accurate
drawing than one made by the best astronomer
who has no ability as a draughtsman. Concerning
the drawings of Mars, if one will turn to
the "Annals of the Lowell Observatory," Volume
I, Plate XIV, he will there see drawings
made on successive nights by Mr. Lowell and
his assistants, Mr. Douglass and Mr. Drew,
showing a remarkable agreement. After finishing
my observations of Mars, which covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
nearly a complete presentation of the planet, I
made a comparison between my drawings and
those made by Professor Lowell and his secretary,
Miss Leonard, and a few made by the
assistant astronomers, Mr. Lampland and Mr.
Slipher, and the agreement was almost absolute,
the only difference being that their drawings
portrayed additional features which in some
cases I had caught a glimpse of but could not
fix. I found it exceedingly difficult to draw in
the correct positions details within a circle, and
particularly when the axis of that circle was
inclined some degrees from the vertical, indicated
by a spider's thread in the ocular.</p>

<p>I think any reasonable man will admit that
the divergence seen in the various drawings of
Mars by different observers cannot be held as an
argument against their existence.</p>

<p><i>In knowledge, that man only is to be condemned

<p class="sigright"><span class="smcap">Faraday.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Having shown to the satisfaction of any
reasonable mind that the delicate lines, known as
canals, do exist, it will be interesting to examine
some of the theories which have been advanced
to explain these markings, as well as some of
the absurd deductions drawn from their existence.
The late Dr. J. Joly, Professor of Geology
in the University of Dublin, in a paper on the
Origin of the Canals of Mars ("Trans." Royal
Soc., Dublin) came to the conclusion that
meteoric bodies, revolving on or near the surface
of Mars, produced these lines. In brief, he
supposed that Mars at various times in the early
stages of his history, when his rotation period
was much shorter, attracted small bodies, which,
after whirling about the planet, finally came
down on the crust and caused these lines. He
conceived of satellites twice the diameter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Phobos, or say, seventy-two miles in diameter,
flying about Mars at a distance of sixty-three
miles, which would at this distance, by its attractive
force, exert a stress on the supposed
thin crust of Mars of from fifteen to thirty tons
per square foot, and thus rend the surface of the
planet in a zone two hundred and twenty miles
wide, thus forming two parallel ridges which
might be visible to us as double canals. This
preposterous idea takes no account of the greater
attractive force of the Earth, and that it too
should have had precisely the same experience,
more often repeated. No trace of such behaviors,
however, has ever been detected. The
Moon, too, should have caught some of these
heavy bodies, but while conspicuous cracks are
seen on her surface, and delicate ridges are seen
radiating from the larger volcanoes, not a trace
of these great meteoric furrows has ever been
observed. It takes no account of the chances&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;one
in a million&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that these cavorting meteors
should meet at common centres, and if they did,
the impossibility that they should stop abruptly
and then start off in opposite directions. It
takes no account of many of the lines following
the arc of a great circle, or what finally became
of three or four hundred of these meteors to
tally with the number of the canals, unless it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
is supposed that some of them went whirling
around the planet three or four times, changing
their courses instantly and repeatedly. Indeed,
the advancement of such absurd ideas shows the
desperate despair of a man who tries to escape
the admission that the lines in question may be
artificial&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and hence the result of intelligence
working to a definite end&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;by a conception as
crazy as one might possibly get in a disordered
dream. To heighten the absurdity of this theory,
if that were possible, Mr. J.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;E. Dryer, who
signs a notice of this paper, while calling attention
to the fact that this hypothesis takes
no account of the correlation of changes in
the canals with seasonal changes on the planet,
otherwise soberly says: "It must be conceded
that there is nothing in the new hypothesis contrary
to observed facts."</p>

<p>Mr. J. Orr, in the pages of the "British Astronomical
Journal," assuming that Schiaparelli
believed that the canals were excavated (despite
the fact that Schiaparelli called them <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i>, or
channels), and compared them to the English
Channel and the Channel of Mozambique&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for
at the outset he had no doubt of their being
natural configurations&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;proceeds to show the
impossibility of an idea that was never entertained.
His attempt is as childish and ridiculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
as the theory he conjures up. Mr. Orr,
taking it for granted that the only explanation
offered for these lines is that they are excavated,
concludes that a Martian canal, like Tartarus,
"should be seventy feet in depth (one might ask,
why not five hundred or five thousand?) and
that the canals of Mars would contain 1,634,000
of our Suez Canals, and would require an army
of two hundred million men, working for one
thousand of our years, for their construction,"
and similar idiocies regarding the population of
Mars, which he concludes "must be 409,000,000,
thus showing that all the adult males, and a large
number of women, must have been engaged in
the great work." In connection with this absurd
travesty, let us pause for a moment to consider
the extraordinary character of the president of
this society before which this paper was read.
A man who is the senior assistant of the Royal
Observatory at Greenwich, instead of rebuking
this balderdash as entirely beside the question,
stated as the result of an experiment with a lot
of charity-school children, that the canals are
merely illusions of the brain, and this in the face
of the testimony of a number of astronomers,
many of whom are highly distinguished, that
the markings do exist. This man seriously
commented on the paper by saying: "He hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
that Mr. Orr's statistical, but nevertheless amusing
and instructive, paper might prove one
more nail in the coffin of a very absurd idea
which had certainly got most undue currency,
namely, that the canals of Mars could possibly
be the work of human agents." Equally astounding,
too, is it that this nonsense the "Astronomical
Journal of the Pacific" republishes
without a word of comment. But what could we
expect of the mentality of the senior assistant
of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, who,
with the great vault of heaven crowded with
enigmas awaiting an answer, should waste a particle
of gray matter in trying to ascertain precisely
where Joshua stood when he commanded
the Sun to stand still so that he could have a
little more time for his bloody work. Even the
day of the month is ascertained; he finds that
the date of this murderous affair was about July
22, and that the Sun must have risen exactly
at 5 <span class="smcap smaller">A. M.</span> and set at 7 <span class="smcap smaller">P. M.</span> The Moon, he concludes,
must have been about its third quarter
and was within half an hour of setting. He
could not fix the year, however! Fancy all this
detail without a word of exegetical criticism, or
comment on the precise words of Joshua. "And
he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou
still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
of Ajalon. And the Sun stood still, and the
Moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves
upon their enemies." Not even a pious
query as to why the Lord did not shower down
a few more meteorites, rather than disarrange
the whole solar system. Such an attitude of the
mind renders one incapable of appreciating anything
in astronomic research beyond that which
can be measured and photographed. The above
is a fair illustration of the intolerable attitude of
many of those who deny the existence of the
canals, or, if admitting them as existent, resort
to every expedient to disprove their artificial
character.</p>

<p>Among the interesting suggestions as to the
cause of the lines on Mars is that proposed by
Professor W.&nbsp;H. Pickering, who, while admitting
that they represent bands of vegetation, believes
that they have their counterpart on the Moon,
and that both are produced by volcanic forces,
the cracking of the surface being the result of
internal strain and stress. The fissures thus
produced permit the escape of water vapor and
carbon dioxide, and thus the natural irrigation
of these cracks is effected and growth of vegetation
follows. This opinion should have great
weight, as Professor Pickering has made a profound
study of lunar details, and is one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
foremost authorities on the subject. He has
also drawn many of the surface features of Mars,
and was at one time connected with the Lowell
Observatory. He it was who suggested irrigation
to account for the great apparent width of
the Martian lines. In the "Annals of the Harvard
College Observatory," Vol. LIII, No. 14,
Professor Pickering presents a study of a crater
on the Moon's surface, known as Eratosthenes,
accompanied by drawings and photographs of an
area within the crater revealing a few irregular
cracks which he thinks correspond to the well-known
canals of Mars; indeed, he calls these
lines canals though he believes them to be
cracks. A few spots, probably craterlets, he
compares to the oases of Lowell. That there is
no atmosphere on the Moon is admitted by all.
Professor Pickering's keen eye has, however, detected
a change in the appearance of these cracks
which he attributes to vegetation, animated in
its growth by water vapor and carbonic acid gas,
as before remarked. In this supposition he may
be right, though it seems difficult to believe that
so deliquescent an organism as a plant could
withstand a variation of temperature from two
to three hundred degrees below zero, to one
above that of boiling water. One might naturally
ask why the greater cracks so conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
on the Moon's surface, typical examples of which
are found in the Mare Serenitis, Mare Triangulatis,
and surroundings, do not emit aqueous
vapor and carbon dioxide, and thus show similar
features of widening and change of shade. Admitting
the correctness of Pickering's views, it
seems impossible to see any resemblance between
this diminutive agglomeration of lines
within a lunar crater, and the great geodetic
lines sweeping for hundreds of miles across the
face of Mars.</p>

<p>In the lunar crater, known as Flammarion's
Circle, a most typical branching crack is seen.
An examination of these lunar cracks, of which I
made drawings through the great telescope at the
Lowell Observatory, showed them to be cracks
of the most unmistakable character, paralleled
on the Earth's surface, by sunbaked fissures. If
volcanic forces have caused these cracks in the
Moon the same kind of energy should have produced
the same general results in Mars, and
circular craters should equally be in evidence,
for many of the lunar craters are sufficiently
large to be detected were they on Mars. They
would certainly be indicated on the terminator,
and yet not a trace of such markings has been
found. It is rather extraordinary, too, that such
earthquake fissures on any great scale should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
not have been filled with trap, silicate, or other
injected material. Indeed it is strange that such
a triangulating arrangement of cracks has not
been found on the Earth's surface.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>MUD CRACKS ON SHORE OF ROGER'S LAKE, ARIZONA</p></div></div>

<p>In order to pronounce the lines on Mars as
simply cracks one should study the various
kinds of cracks in similar surfaces on the Earth.
In such a study he would be amazed at the similarity
of cracks. When there is a grain in the
substance, as in wood, the cracks follow the
grain, though even in this material they are
discontinuous. In amorphous material they
have essentially the same character; whether
in the almost microscopic crackle of old Satsuma
pottery, or huge cracks in sun-dried mud, the
areas enclosed are generally polygonal. If the
material be of impalpable fineness the edges of
the cracks are smooth and clean-cut, as in
Plate III, from a Chinese bowl; whereas if the
material is coarse and pebbly the edges of the
cracks are rough and irregular, as in Plate IV,
from the muddy shores of a lake. Cracks arising
from contraction never converge to a
common centre, and when not connected with
another crack they taper to a point. They
begin at indefinite places and end in an equally
indefinite manner. That there should be a
common resemblance in cracks due to contraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
is evident as they arise from a shrinking
of the surface. The most ancient deposits,
millions of ages ago, reveal mud cracks differing
in no respect from those found to-day. We
subjoin a few forms of cracks from various
surfaces, to show their essential resemblance.
It will be seen that the cracks in the Moon
are identical in character to those found on
the Mesa at Flagstaff. They start from some
indefinite point, are irregular in outline and
end as indefinitely. A poor asphalt pavement
offers one of the best opportunities for the study
of the formation of various kinds of cracks and
fissures. On the edge of a sloping sidewalk
one may see the cracks due to a sliding, or
lateral displacement of the surface; the effects
of subsidence show a number of cracks around
the area of depression; the growth of a tree
crowding the asphalt shows the effect of lateral
thrust, and an enlargement of a root below,
or the effects of frost show cracks due to elevation.
All these various cracks reveal the
same features: they are discontinuous, they
begin and end without definition. Schiaparelli
says in regard to the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i> of Mars: "None
of them have yet been seen cut off in the middle
of the continent, remaining without beginning or
without end." These lines on the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Mars, as a writer in "Nature" says, are almost
without exception geodetically straight, supernaturally
so, and this in spite of their leading
in every possible direction. It is inconceivable
that cracks should be laid out with such geodetic
precision. We have seen that cracks have no
definite beginning or termination; we have seen
that the lines of Mars begin and end at definite
places. Cracks are irregular, vary in width and
differ entirely from the straight lines depicted
by Schiaparelli, Lowell, and others. But if we
admit them to be natural cracks in the crust
we are compelled to admit that the forces implicated
in such cracks must have been active
many millions of years ago, as Mars, being a
much older planet than the Earth, must have
long since ceased to show those activities which
the Earth, even to-day, exhibits in such phenomena
as earthquakes, subsidences, elevations,
and the like. Now cracks made at that early
time in the history of the planet must have
long since become filled with detritus and obliterated
in other ways, and no evidence would
show, even on close inspection, of their former
existence, much less at a distance of 50,000,000
of miles, more or less.</p>

<p>In Plate V, page 112, are given six figures representing
various cracks and fissures. No. 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
represents the cracks in the glaze of Japanese
pottery, magnified. No. 2 shows the mud cracks
on the edge of a lake, to the extent of two feet.
No. 3 is a series of cracks in an asphalt pavement,
covering about two feet. No. 4 shows the
form of cracks in the surface of a mesa in Arizona,
the result of the summer heat, the length
being about ten feet. No. 5 is a tracing from a
drawing by Professor W.&nbsp;H. Pickering showing
cracks in the lunar crater Eratosthenes, with an
extent of fifty-five miles. The original drawing
represented a much greater widening of the lines
which Professor Pickering believes to be due to
vegetation. I endeavored to trace the centre of
each line and Professor Pickering said in regard
to my tracing: "In one or two instances you
have assumed that a crack went through the
middle of a broad space, whereas, for aught we
know, it may have gone along either edge, but
otherwise the tracing obviously follows the outlines
of my drawing." It evidently gives a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cachet</i> of what appears to be veritable cracks on
the surface, and it is interesting to compare this
drawing with the cracks in the asphalt. In No.
6 are two drawings; one marked A represents
cracks in a region of the Moon known as Flammarion's
Circle, the other B represents the great
rift in southern Africa, probably the most stupendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
phenomenon in geological history.
This rift has been traced from the Valley of the
Jordan through the Dead Sea, into the Gulf of
Akaba, thence into the Red Sea, which it follows
the entire length, then turning southwesterly
into Africa and branching, one branch takes in
Lake Tanganyika, and the other branch Lake
Nyassa. A portion north of Nyassa is still problematical.
Here is a crack 1,500 miles long,
most of it filled with detritus, water, or forest.
It would be an interesting question whether such
a fracture would be visible even from the Moon.
A glance at these various figures will give one
a conception of the similarity of cracks, their
irregular contour, their indeterminate origin, and
ending. Cracks arising from shrinkage vary
only in the material in which the crack takes
place; the conditions resulting from shrinkage
or pulling apart are precisely the same.</p>

<p>Let us now glance at a series of figures on
Plate VI, page 113; their artificial character may
be recognized at once. They are all designed for
channels or thoroughfares for the transportation
of men, merchandise, or water. No. 1 represents
a tracing from a railroad map of a county
in Illinois. The convergence of lines to common
centres, and, in one case, parallel lines may be
seen. The length of the region represented is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
thirty-seven miles. No. 2 is a tracing of streets
in a district of Montreal, covering an extent of
half a mile. No. 3 is a tracing of a small region
near Ph&oelig;nix, Arizona, showing irrigating canals.
The larger ones follow contour lines of the surface;
the smaller ones are usually laid out in
rectangular form to correspond with the original
land sections and sub-sections, the boundary lines
of which run north and south, east and west.
No. 4 represents the canals converging on Groningen,
Holland. No. 5 is a tracing from a
hemispherical map of Mars made by Schiaparelli,
and No 6 is traced from a photograph of a globe
on which Lowell has carefully drawn the canals,
oases, etc., of Mars covering a land extent of
7,400 miles. The remarkable artificiality of all
these figures must be admitted. The lines on
the first four figures are laid out by an intelligence
for similar purposes. No. 1 for the conveyance
of passengers and freight; No. 2 for the
traffic of a city; No. 3 for the conveyance of
water; No. 4 for purposes of navigation, and
Nos. 5 and 6, according to Lowell's view, for the
conveyance of water from melting polar snow
caps for irrigation purposes. A simple, rational
explanation, as their great width and geodetic
precision forbid any other.</p>

<p>Let one contemplate these lines of Mars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
and compare them with the natural cracks on
Plate V and he will appreciate the emphatic
words of Lowell when he says: "The mere aspect
is enough to cause all theories about glaciation,
fissures, or surface cracks to die an instant
and natural death." Consider any other possible
tracing of lines on the face of the Earth as the
result of Nature's forces, such as river beds,
cañons, chasms, fissures, faults, rifts, precipitous
valleys, fiords, the results of sharp folds in the
strata, parallel chains of mountains, and none
of these lines would be straight, none of them
would be of uniform width, and few of them
would have the enormous breadth of the Martian
lines, they would begin nowhere and, with the
exception of the rivers, end nowhere. This definition
holds good as the result of natural forces
from the microscopic crackle on a dinner plate,
to a crack in the Earth's crust fifteen hundred
miles long.</p>

<p>Having briefly alluded to some of the theories
advanced to explain the geodetic network of
lines encircling Mars&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;theories in one case so
puerile, and in another case an interpretation so
monstrous, though endorsed by astronomers of
standing&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;we turn to the suggestion that these
various lines are artificial, that they were designed
for a definite purpose, namely, to conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
water from those regions alone where water is
found for the purposes of irrigation. We shall
call attention to a parallel case where the great
ice caps and glaciers of the Himalaya Mountains
supply water, by their melting, for thousands of
miles of irrigating canals. Let us ask ourselves
whether if the snows of the Himalayas gradually
failed, the crowded millions of India would not
if necessary reach out to the farthest North for
this precious fluid? Our great centres of population
at the present time are reaching out in
every direction for water supply. How long
would it take New York City to decide in case
of water famine to tap the Great Lakes to the
north, or to establish pipe lines to the north
pole, if it were necessary to go that distance
for water?</p>

<p>From the foregoing it is seen that the question
of water supply has engaged the energies
of man from pre-historic times. These great
irrigating works are found, however, in regions
of sterility, or light rainfall, from the rude
irrigating canals of ancient Peru and Arizona
to the marvellous accomplishments of the hydraulic
engineer in India and Egypt. This demand
for more water is not, however, confined
to regions of sterility, the reaching out of cities
for supplies of water for potable purposes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
for the wasteful disposal of sewage was inevitable.
What shall we say, however, of the
notes of warning in regions of rain?</p>

<p>England is considered a land of humidity
and copious rains, and yet the alarm is already
sounded that in the no distant future an appalling
catastrophe may threaten her in the failure
of her water supply. In a special despatch to
the "New York Herald," Mr. Bently, president
of the Royal Meteorological Society, is quoted as
saying at its Annual Meeting, "So enormous
now is the drain upon the country's available
supplies, so much have the growth of cities,
the disappearance of forested areas, the extent
of street surface impervious to moisture, and
the diversion of the rivers, lakes, and other
natural fresh water reservoirs from their natural
function of irrigators and distributors of the all
essential moisture to the land interfered in
England with nature's arrangements, that English
engineers and meteorologists at no distant
date may find a task of almost insuperable
difficulty awaiting their endeavors."</p>

<p>Dr. Mill, a rainfall expert, on being consulted
by a "Daily Mail" correspondent regarding this
alarming statement, was of the opinion that
the question would require early consideration.
We quote his words as follows: "Legislation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
needed in the immediate future for the regulation
of the rivers. The great question is how
to store the water which at present runs to
waste on the coasts."</p>

<p>"The planting of trees on the high water-sheds
is one of the first solutions of the problem. The
chief difficulty lies in the scarcity of suitable
land available for building large reservoirs, and
at some future date the services of engineers
will be required to reform the present arrangement
of reservoirs."</p>

<p>"In Austria the government issues an annual
report on the condition of the Danube and detailed
statistics of the rainfall, with a view to
storing all the available water supplies. The
work done by the Austrian government I am
doing in regard to the British Isles on my own
responsibility, but the rainfall and the river
conditions are only a portion of a much larger
problem."</p>

<p>The above quotations indicate that even now
an alarm is felt in countries of fair rainfall regarding
the possible failure of the water supply
in the near future and is perhaps a premonition
as to what may be absorbing our energies in
centuries to come. Such possibilities as here
suggested may offer an additional clew to an
interpretation of the Martian markings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
The unnatural straightness of these interlacing
lines on Mars, many of them following the
arcs of great circles, their uniform width
throughout, their always starting from definite
areas, their convergence to common centres, and
their varying visibility synchronizing with the
Martian seasons finds no parallel in natural
phenomena.</p>

<p>If in the mind's eye we were to survey the
Earth from Mars the only feature we should
find at all paralleling the lines in Mars would
be found in the level regions of the West,
where, for thousands of miles, the land extends
in vast level stretches. In these regions would
be found lines of railroads running in straight
courses, starting from definite places, converging
to common centres, their sides, in certain
seasons, conspicuous with ripening grain fields,
or again the work of the United States Reclamation
Bureau running its irrigating canals
in various directions through that great region.
Both these kinds of lines would be artificial and
both designed for purposes of conveyance&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in
the one case, merchandise and passengers,
in the other case, water.</p>

<p>If the Martian lines are not artificial some
other theories must be offered than those thus far
advanced to explain their origin and purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
The phenomenon of the extraordinary doubling
of the canals when first announced was
immediately disbelieved; when, however, other
observers confirmed Schiaparelli's discoveries,
and it became evident that these double lines
had a veritable existence, the phenomenon was
regarded as an evidence that profound physical
changes were going on in the planet. Thus in
1887 Mr. Stanislaus Maunier, in "La <span class="locked">Nature,"<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span>
in alluding to the remarkable discovery of the
doubling of the canals, says: "Mars at this
moment is the theatre of phenomena of stupendous
grandeur which will be adequate in a few
years to impress profound changes in its aspect."
This was written in 1887, and continuous observations
of the planet since that time have
shown no profound changes, or changes of any
kind beyond those which periodically occur with
the seasons. Since Mars is a much older planet
than the Earth, it seems reasonable to believe
that it is more stable, that volcanoes and earthquakes
have long ceased to manifest their activities,
that erosive action by water is no longer in
evidence, subsidence and elevation of continental
areas no longer occur. From this condition of
the planet it is impossible to believe that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
curious phenomenon of the doubling or gemination
of the canals can be due to any physical
changes now taking place.</p>

<p>Schiaparelli said that many of the ingenious
suppositions advanced to account for this doubling
of the canals would not have been proposed
had their authors been able to examine the
gemination with their own eyes; he further
says: "It is far easier to explain the gemination
if we are willing to introduce the forces pertaining
to organic nature; here the field of plausible
supposition is immense," and in this field of
suppositions he suggests "changes of vegetation
over vast areas." Let any intelligent mind
soberly consider this rational suggestion of
Schiaparelli's and compare it with other theories
that have been advanced, and he will be compelled
to admit that vegetation alone gives us
at least a clew to the extraordinary behavior
of these parallel lines. To understand the symmetry,
the suddenness, and the vast extent of
this phenomenon, the further explanation of
vegetation superinduced by artificial methods
will alone complete the answer.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Ball cannot conceive how Mars,
a much older planet, should develop synchronously
with the Earth creatures of intelligence,
an event which he insists should have occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
ages earlier in its history. In this supposition
he is quite right, for if there are creatures of
intelligence in Mars these should have appeared
much earlier, and that is probably what has
happened. The problem is one parallel to that
urged by Sir Boyd Dawkins in regard to the
evidences of man in the Tertiary rocks. Dawkins
argued that since the mammals in the
Tertiary had changed so profoundly, many types
becoming extinct, if man had lived at that time
he also should have been affected by the same
influences, and should have changed accordingly.
It has been clearly pointed out by Cope and
others that the moment intelligence became
a factor in natural selection it was seized upon
to the relative exclusion of physical characteristics,
hence but little change, otherwise than
an intellectual one, has taken place in man
since his progenitors took to the trees and made
up by agility, cunning, and alertness what they
lacked in physical strength. In the same way,
if, in the past history of Mars, an intelligent
creature appeared he must have survived under
precisely similar conditions, and long after favorable
environments had passed that were implicated
in making him what he was.</p>

<p>Admitting that there is an intelligent creature
of some kind in Mars, is it reasonably conceivable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
that he should have caused such changes in
the surface features of that planet as to be
visible from the Earth? Professor Newcomb concludes,
in a recent article in "Harper's Magazine,"
that "we cannot expect to see any signs
of the works of inhabitants in Mars, if such
exist." Let us, however, reverse the proposition
and ask ourselves if man has been implicated in
any changes in the surface appearance of the
Earth that would be visible from Mars? And I
think the question can be answered in only one
way. The vast cities such as Pekin, Tokio,
London, and New York, with their great expanse
of tiled and slated roofs, and sterile streets, would
certainly have a different albedo from the grass
and trees in the immediate outskirts of such
places. The tracts of land reclaimed from the
sea, and still more the enormous areas which
have been rendered green by irrigation, must, of
all contrasts, be markedly conspicuous. To realize
the extent of this work, it is only necessary
to state that in Egypt 6,000,000 acres depend
upon irrigation, and this area to be vastly increased
in a short time; the Western states of
America with 10,000,000 acres, and this area
being rapidly augmented by the work of the
United States Reclamation Bureau; in India
25,000,000 acres under irrigation, and this being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
continually added to; above all, however, the
vast extent of territory from which the dark
forests have been removed in this country, and
more particularly in China, must make a visible
landmark. If one can recall the appearance of
forests in the southern and middle part of
Maine, say from Bethel or Bangor, fifty years
ago, he will remember that from the top of any
hill a stretch of dark blue forest was to be seen
as far as the eye could reach, and now from the
same elevations one can see only an occasional
clump of blue forest, while the remaining surface
is, according to the season, either bright
green, yellow with ripening vegetation, or white
with snow, out of which the dark clumps of
forest growth are most conspicuous. Considering
the contrasting colors in one year covering
hundreds of thousands of square miles in
various portions of the country, the question
naturally arises which of these contrasts would
be most conspicuous,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the colors just mentioned
of solid land surfaces of vegetation, snow, and
desert, or diaphanous clouds with their gray
shadows. We are told that Jupiter, with the
mean distance at opposition of nearly 400,000,000
miles, shows its clouds, its red spot,
and the shadow transits of its satellites. Surely
if these conditions are seen from the Earth, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
changes in the Earth's appearance above described
might be seen from Mars, which at its
nearest opposition is only 35,000,000 miles
away, and, conversely, any change of similar
character in Mars would certainly be visible
from the Earth.</p>

<p>It will be of interest to examine the writings
of certain astronomers, and writers on astronomy,
to appreciate the unreasonable conservatism, not
to say narrow-mindedness, which color their
opinions. It ill becomes students of science to
ridicule the honest and persistent labors of such
men as Schiaparelli, Lowell, Perrotin, and others,
unless they can show an equal devotion to the
work. They do not recall the deluge of essays,
reviews, and sober treatises which followed
Darwin's great work, viewing the evidences of
Darwin not thoughtfully, nor based upon any
knowledge of the subject, but with contempt, and,
in many instances, with vituperation. So rapid,
however, was the recognition of Darwin's interpretation
of Nature's facts that most of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
writers lived long enough to see their protests
entirely discredited, or to become enthusiastic
advocates of the theory.</p>

<p>In their own domain of astronomy these
writers are equally forgetful of the earnest and
even bitter controversies regarding the demonstration
by Chandler of the oscillation of the
poles, and consequent variation of latitude, and
the final establishment of Chandler's views, in
the teeth of opposition, by the greatest astronomers.</p>

<p>The character of this irrelevant and adverse
criticism may be appreciated by subjoining a
few examples. The most amazing of all these
expressions is to be found in the report of the
British Astronomical Association, for 1892. It
seems that a committee had been appointed by
the Association to report on the surface features
of Mars. E. Walter Maunder was made Director
of the Committee. Twenty-six observers,
of whom twenty-one were inhabitants of Great
Britain, sent in the result of their work accompanied
by drawings. A summary of this work
was published in the form of memoranda accompanied
by a Mercator projection map of
Mars, individual planisphere drawings, as well
as colored plates; these together represented
twenty-eight single canals, five double canals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
nine oases, as well as the dark regions so long
familiar to astronomers. This was a somewhat
remarkable contribution considering the complaints
from the different observers in regard
to the weather, and the prejudiced, and negligent
part played by the man at the helm.
That I am not unjust in these statements may
be understood by quoting from the report showing
the conditions under which the English
observers labored, the delinquent part which
Mr. Maunder, the Director, played in the
matter, and the conclusions which Mr. Maunder
arrived at after this unsatisfactory performance.
He says: "The opposition of 1892 proved on
the whole a very disappointing one. Although
Mars at opposition was almost at its nearest
approach to the Earth, it was far from being
well placed for observation by European astronomers
owing to its great southerly declination,
and consequent low <span class="locked">altitude.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> The weather
during the autumn of 1892 was for the most
part very unfavorable for observation of so
difficult an object, and several members who
joined the section at the beginning were unable
to contribute either drawings or report."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>
<p>Now I beg the reader to carefully note the
part the Director played in this important work.
Here are his words; there is no need of italicizing
them. "None of the few evenings which
the Director was able to give to the examination
of the planet was really suitable for the purpose,
and as the pressure of other duties rendered it
impossible for him to supply any detailed help
to the members, the section was at a very
serious disadvantage." He certainly is frank
enough to state the disadvantages the section
was under with such a man at the head. Realizing
the conditions of seeing in the fog and
soot-begrimed atmosphere of England, the low
altitude of Mars, and the loss to the committee
of the assistance which a Director might have
given to the work had he been able to approach
the subject in a broad and unprejudiced manner,
one is naturally led to ask what this committee
would have accomplished if each member in
turn had had an opportunity of observing Mars
at a high altitude with a twenty-four inch refractor
of remarkable definition, at an elevation
of 7,000 feet above the sea-level, in an atmosphere
so clear and steady that stars of the third
and fourth magnitude may be seen to set at the
horizon line.</p>

<p>Mr. Maunder in speaking of the nomenclature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
used in his report says, "The term 'canal'
has also been retained, though 'canals' in the
sense of being artificial productions, the markings
of Mars which bear that name, are certainly
not. It is difficult, indeed, to understand
how so preposterous an idea obtained currency
for a moment even by the most ignorant." It
is impossible to repress one's amazement at
these expressions after the confessions he makes
as to his official functions on the committee, and
I appeal to any honest and unprejudiced mind
if a more incompetent person of the class to
which he belongs could have been found in
England for the Directorship of such a body.
In this connection we cannot refrain from giving
a few paragraphs from a paper entitled "Can
Organic Life Exist in the Planetary System?"
by C.&nbsp;A. Stetefeldt. The author says: "We
must, however, acknowledge that if other suns
in the universe have planets&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and there is
no reason why they should not&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;many of them
may present physical conditions identical with,
or similar to, those existing on the Earth, and
that therefore their organic life may be similar
to our own. Further, I am far from denying
that, under favorable circumstances, creatures
may be evolved upon planets which revolve
around other suns, whose mental capacity is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
much superior to man's as that of the latter is to
the lowest form of vertebrates." Having made
these liberal admissions in regard to the universe
at large he attempts to show that none
of the planets outside the Earth could sustain
life, and finally closes in this extraordinary
manner: "In concluding this investigation we
cannot help admiring the inductive acumen of
the theologians who considered the Earth the
most important of the planets, and the centre
of creation. Although their opinions were not
based upon scientific facts, they <em>arrived at the
truth nevertheless</em>." (Italics ours.) Familiar as
every one is with the attitude of theologians for
the last several centuries concerning astronomical
discovery I think it may be safely said that
this is the first instance on record where they
have been credited with an induction not based
on observed facts worth quoting in an astronomical
paper. And this contribution also appeared
in the publications of the "Astronomical Society
of the Pacific," Volume VI, No. 25, without a
word of comment! How different was the behavior
of the "Journal" when a report of
Percival Lowell's lecture on Mars, written by
Dr. Edward Everett Hale, was reproduced in
its pages. The following comments were made
by Edward S. Holden, then Director of the Lick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Observatory: "Something is seen, no doubt,
but I may add that nothing has been observed
at the Lick Observatory during the years 1888&ndash;1895,
so far as I know, which goes to confirm
the very striking conclusions here described."
It may be added that during the years 1888&ndash;1892
nothing was seen of the fifth moon of
Jupiter. The discovery of this satellite with
the Lick telescope was not due to any special
efforts on the part of the Director.</p>

<p>The Rev. E. Ledger, "Nineteenth Century
Magazine," Volume LIII, 1903, p. 773, in an
article entitled "The Canals of Mars&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Are
they Real?" presents an excellent account of
the successive observers of Mars, and the results
of their work, and the objections of those who
could not see the canals, or saw them imperfectly.
He recalls Maunder's childish experiments,
and is greatly impressed by them. He
then says: "Astronomers are no doubt very
well acquainted with the laws of optics as applied
to the eye. They have made, and may
yet make, many experiments connected with
their action. They are accustomed to allow for
individual peculiarities in observation, as, for
instance, when what is termed personal equation
affects the rapidity with which different
observers touch a key to record what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
see. They may therefore skilfully judge of
the effect produced in observations of Mars by
such processes of the eye, or of the brain, or
nervous system as I have referred to." He
strongly thinks it would be well "if some skilful
nerve specialist and oculist could work in
conjunction with some of these practised observers
who have seen the canals. They might
both assist in observing, and at the same time
carry out careful researches into the optical
delusions which brain or eye may experience in
connection with telescopic observation." This
is certainly a happy thought of the reverend
author, only it would seem in this case that a
larger and more diversified corps of specialists,
including alienists, is needed to attend to that
class of astronomers who are suffering with
mental strabismus. It might be advisable to
call in the services of a bacteriologist to make
cultures of new forms of microbes which may
be involved in rendering a man incapable of
estimating the value of evidence.</p>

<p>It is the exception rather than the rule in
astronomical science that one finds such unfounded
and prejudiced utterances as those
above commented upon. The glamour of astrology
still lingers, in the public eye in its
respect and awe for the astronomer's work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Every eclipse seems in the nature of a prophecy.
The public contributes liberally for the support
of eclipse expeditions, observatories, and the like,
and these contributions would be still more
liberal if the public could realize the profound
significance of the researches now being carried
on by Director Pickering at Harvard, Director
Campbell at Lick, Director Hale at the
Solar Observatory, Mount Wilson, and many
others. Their observations are received without
question. The thoughtful man would only
ask that like credence should be given to the
work of every earnest student unless disproved,
even though the field of investigation covers
regions hitherto but little explored, and yet of
the very greatest interest to the human race.</p>

<p>Schiaparelli points out that "the polar
snows of Mars prove in an incontrovertible
manner that the planet, like the Earth, is surrounded
by an atmosphere capable of transporting
vapor from one place to another." Mr. E.&nbsp;E.
Barnard, in the "Astrophysical Journal,"
Volume XVII, No. 4, in speaking of the polar
caps, says: "There seems no definite proof that
they are not as much ice and snow as that which
we have to deal with in our own terrestrial
winters. So much is at least suggested by the
great seasonal changes they undergo from winter
to summer. There seems to be a general belief
now that Mars certainly has an atmosphere.
This atmosphere seems to be very much less than
our own, and yet it is of sufficient density to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
produce the phenomena of the polar caps by condensation
and evaporation and also to produce,
though rarely, some form of clouds."</p>

<p>Among those who have claimed to have established
the existence of water vapor in Mars by
the spectroscope are Rutherford, Secchi, Huggins,
Janssen, and Vogel; and these declare the
existence of a Martian atmosphere similar to our
own in composition. Mr. Campbell can find no
spectroscopic indication of an atmosphere charged
with water vapor. Lewis E. Jewell says: "The
spectroscopic proof of the presence of a fair
amount of water in the atmosphere of Mars must
be regarded as unattainable." Professor Lowell,
despite the aid the admission of water vapor in
Mars would give to his position, also doubts
whether the spectroscope is able to detect the
evidence through our own moisture-laden
atmosphere.</p>

<p>After a minute and exhaustive study of the
polar snow caps by the combined observations of
Lowell, Douglass and W.&nbsp;H. Pickering, Mr.
Lowell says: "It is interesting that the cap
should so simply tell us of these three important
things: the presence of air, the presence of
water, and the presence of a temperature, not
incomparable with that of the Earth."</p>

<p>Seasonal changes on Mars have long been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
recognized and admitted by astronomers, and
these changes are on so vast a scale as to be distinctly
visible from the earth. Without an
atmosphere the surface of Mars would be inert.
Schiaparelli was the first to notice that at successive
oppositions the same regions showed different
degrees of darkness and accounted for
these variations by seasonal change. Mr. Denning
believes that certain changes in the appearance
of the markings to be due to vaporous
condensations. Sir Norman Lockyer believed he
saw the obscuration of a large region by clouds,
this obscuration continuing for some hours. A
bright spot on the terminator of Mars, discovered
by Douglass at the Lowell Observatory, and
which led to the newspaper excitement that
signals were being made, was seen to move and
finally disappear and its appearance, drift and
disappearance is interpreted by Lowell as a cloud
illuminated by the Sun and carried along by the
wind. The presence of clouds, judging from my
own brief experience, was certainly suggested at
times by the peculiar way in which a large
region known as Syrtis Major disappeared and
flashed out again. This behavior might be
expected of the tenuous lines as a result of refraction
and other disturbances in our own atmosphere;
when, however, a large, dark region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
at one time stands out firm, clear and sharp-cut
as the stroke of a Japanese brush, then gradually
fades out and remains obscure for some time we
are inclined to believe that Sir Norman Lockyer's
interpretation is true and that in such a case
drifting clouds or sudden vaporous condensation
produced the obscuration.</p>

<p>From an article on Mars by Sir Robert Ball,
republished in the "Annual Report of the Smithsonian
Institution" for 1900, we quote the following:
"The discussion we have just given will
prepare us to believe that a planet with the size
and mass of Mars may be expected to be encompassed
with an atmosphere. Our telescopic
observations completely bear this out. It is
perfectly certain that there is a certain shell of
gaseous material investing Mars. This is shown
in various ways. We note the gradual obscuration
of objects on the planet as they approach
the edge of the disk, where they are necessarily
viewed through a greatly increased thickness of
Martian atmosphere. We also observe the clearness
with which objects are exhibited at the
centre of the disk of Mars, and though this may
be in some measure due to the absence of distortion
from the effects of foreshortening, it undoubtedly
arises to some extent from the fact
that objects in this position are viewed through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
comparatively small thickness of the atmosphere
enveloping the planet. Clouds are also sometimes
seen apparently floating in the upper region
of Mars. This, of course, is possible only on the
supposition that there must be an atmosphere
which formed the vehicle by which clouds were
borne along. It is, however, quite obvious that
the extent of the Martian atmosphere must be
quite insignificant when compared with that by
which our Earth is enveloped. It is a rare circumstance
for any of the main topographical
features, such as the outlines of its so-called continents,
or the coasts of its so-called seas, to be
obscured by clouds to an extent which is appreciable
except by very refined observations."</p>

<p>Professor W.&nbsp;H. Pickering made seven photographs
of Mars on April 9, and within twenty-four
hours made seven additional photographs of
the same region. The second series of photographs
showed an area of white extending from
the polar snow cap far down toward the equator,
covering a surface which he estimated to be as
large as the United States. It afterwards slowly
disappeared. How shall we account for this
sudden apparition of a vast area of white which
the photographs of twenty-four hours before did
not reveal. A boy of ten, as well as the philosopher
would simply say a snow-storm had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
taken place in Mars. Is it, then, unreasonable
to picture whirling snowflakes, snow-drifts, and
dazzling whiteness from the Sun's rays, and in
the rapid melting of the snow, broad rivers and
turbulent brooks with water areas frozen at
night? But why should we be compelled to
imagine as naked the surface through which
these waters find their way? Soil there must be
from the continual erosion of running water.
The character of the rock exposures we cannot
guess at, but a picture of bare rock and lifeless
ground is unthinkable. Such wide-spread storms
without an atmosphere could not occur. The
seasonal appearance of these snows and their slow
disappearance not only indicates an atmosphere,
but an atmosphere disturbed by established currents
which convey the moisture-laden air to
regions of congelation.</p>

<p>A number of observers who have detected
clouds in Mars described them as being yellowish
in color. What more probable than that these
yellowish masses are simply dust-storms such
as one may often see whirling along over our
American deserts? When the gusts of wind are
fitful like squalls at sea, the obscuration would
be fitful, to clear up again. The vast areas of
desert land in Mars renders this supposition very
probable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Since the above was written, my attention has
been called to an early "Bulletin of the Lowell
Observatory," in which Mr. Lowell, in discussing
the appearance of a certain large projection on
the terminator of Mars, says: "Finally, its color
leads me to believe it not a cloud of water-vapor,
but a cloud of dust. Other phenomena of the
planet bear out this supposition."</p>

<p>Let one stand on some peak of the Verd
Mountains, northeast from Phoenix, Arizona,
overlooking the Gila River as it follows its course
across the desert, and after the river is lost to
view he will notice that the foliage along its
banks marks its course. If one takes this view
in winter time, the uniform gray of the plains,
unbroken by a single shade of color blends with
the light blue of the distant Plomas and Castle
Dome Mountains on the southwest horizon. In
the early spring when the water is first let into
the irrigating channels with their innumerable
divergent ditches, a shade of green may be seen
emerging from the monotonous yellow-gray of
the hot and sterile plain, first conspicuous near
the source of the water supply, and then following
along to Phoenix, Tempe, and other regions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
till in full efflorescence these cities stand out like
great green carpets spread upon the Earth. From
this mountain top not a trace of an irrigating
ditch, large or small, would be discerned, except
here and there a glint of reflected sunlight, but
the effects of the life-giving waters can be traced
in broad bands to the remotest limits of the
water channels, when they would end as abruptly
as they had begun.</p>

<p>If we examine railroad maps, the lines of which
represent the road-beds utilized to convey passengers
and freight to various places, we shall
observe that in mountainous regions the lines
run very irregularly, often paralleling mountain
chains, or following rivers. On level areas such
as Iowa, Texas, and other states, the railroads
run for hundreds of miles in straight lines, at
times converging towards large centres of population.
Their occasional parallelism and radiation
from centres, all present a certain <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cachet</i> in
angles of approach and alignment that reminds
one strongly of similar features in the markings
of Mars. If each railroad were bordered by a
wide growth of trees with sterile desert between,
these broad bands as seen from Mars would be
identical with the appearance of similar lines in
Mars as seen from the Earth. In Mars, however,
there are no high elevations since the terminator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
of Mars stands out clear cut and not jagged as
in the Moon. The planet being devoid of hill
ranges, and large oceans, the canals can run in
straight lines for hundreds of miles. If it were
possible to conceive by analogy a creature on
Mars furnished with a telescope, he would undoubtedly
correlate the irrigating regions of Arizona
as similar in nature to his own canals.
The irregularity of the rivers running through
such regions would puzzle him quite as much as
we are puzzled by the absolute straightness of
the Martian canals. He would, of course, observe
that in our winter the irrigating areas became
invisible, to appear again as our summer advanced.
His own experience of vegetation arising
from irrigation alone and starting from the
north when the first water from the melting
snow cap animated the growth of plant life, and
proceeding slowly towards the equator would
prevent him from understanding the reverse condition
on our planet, with the shade of green being
perennial at the equator and spreading slowly
north with the advance of summer.</p>

<p>The marvels of irrigation are impossible to
conceive of without first seeing a parched land
before the water channels are dug and the exuberant
vegetation springing with the water's
advent. The illimitable stretches of arid plain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
no green, rarely an evidence of life, and then
usually in hideous shapes like the hissing and
purple-mouthed Gila monster; hot pale dust;
blinding sunlight; ragged clumps of gray sagebrush,
rebuking by their hopeless color and
dishevelled appearance, the intolerable condition
of their existence; angular cacti, surviving because
of their vicious needles, and then literally
a step only from this sterile waste, and one finds
himself wading through rich, soft alfalfa, under
the deep shade of cottonwood trees, glistening
threads of water when the overhanging vegetation
does not hide the channels, brilliant flowers,
singing birds, fat cattle and vociferous children.</p>

<p>In this apparently irreclaimable desert of Arizona,
have sprung up prosperous cities, great
farms and fruit orchards. About Phoenix, more
than one hundred and twenty-five thousand acres
are under the richest and most profitable cultivation,
and all due to a little narrow canal which
conveys the water from Salado River, and distributes
it by narrow ditches, so narrow, indeed,
as to be invisible except on the nearest approach.
There have already been constructed in the Gila
Valley alone, two hundred and fifty miles of
ditches, and four hundred miles of parallels. Mr.
Ray Stannard Baker, in the "Century" for July,
1902, presents in a graphic way, the marvels of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
irrigation. Major J.&nbsp;W. Powell, during the later
years of his life devoted his whole time and
energy to urging the reclamation of desert lands
in the West by irrigation. In his reports on the
subject he estimated that a region equal in size
to New England, New York, Pennsylvania, and
West Virginia could be recovered from the desert
sands of Arizona and other regions in the West.
In India, millions of pounds have been spent for
irrigating canals and ditches. A single canal
with its tributaries drawing water from the
Ganges measures 3,910 miles in length, bringing
into cultivation one million acres of land at an
expense of fifteen millions of dollars. The idea
of irrigation is not due to the advanced intellect
of man; it has been the result of dire necessity
and is of great antiquity. Mr. Frank Hamilton
Cushing discovered evidences of the most extensive
irrigating canals among the ancient
Pueblo Indians of Arizona.</p>

<p>Sir C. Scott Moncrief, in his address as president
of the engineering section of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, describes
the various forms of irrigation. The
primitive method consists in raising water by
human labor. Early Egyptian sculpture depicts
laborers raising water by means of buckets, and
along the banks of the Nile the same method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
may be seen to-day. Other methods of raising
water are by pumps driven by windmills. In
certain regions Artesian wells furnish water for
irrigation. The importance of irrigation is best
shown in the fact, that, while the rainfall in
Cairo is, on an average, one and four tenths
inches a year, yet in the immediate neighborhood
land brings $750 per acre; this value being
due to irrigation alone. In speaking of water
storage for supplying the irrigating canals the
author says: "When there is no moderating
lake, a river fed by a glacier has a precious
source of supply. The hotter the weather the
more rapidly will the ice melt, and this is just
when irrigation is most wanted." (Judging
from this dictum, the condition in Mars is ideal.)
In speaking of the great Assouan Reservoir in
Egypt, he says: "The sale value of land irrigated
by its waters will be increased by about
$125,000,000. The increase in irrigation areas
in our Western States may be appreciated by
the following figures. In 1889 it amounted to
3,564,416 acres; in 1900, to 7,539,545 acres.
Now it is at least 10,000,000 acres. Without
irrigation this land sold for four or five dollars
per acre; with irrigation it brings forty dollars
per acre.</p>

<span class="subhead">VARIETY OF CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH
LIFE EXISTS</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Not only does life but intelligence flourish on
this globe under a great variety of conditions,
as regards temperature and surroundings, and
no sound reason can be shown why under certain
conditions which are frequent in the universe,
intelligent beings should not acquire the
highest development.</i></p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="smcap">Simon Newcomb.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The argument most often urged against the
idea that life exists in Mars is that there is no
atmosphere in that planet, or if there is one it is
so rarefied that it could not sustain life as we
know it. According to Proctor, we have heretofore
been led to consider the planet's physical
condition as adapted to the wants of creatures
which exist upon our own Earth rather than to
ascertain the conditions which might obtain to
enable life to exist on the surface of other
planets. It is highly probable that if an air-breathing
animal of our earth were instantly
immersed in an atmosphere as rare as that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Mars, it would perish in a short time. Precisely
what a species through thousands of generations
of selection and survival might adapt itself to, is
an open question. Leaving this contention for
a moment, let us consider the almost infinite
variety of conditions under which life exists on
our globe, and we shall find that any and all
conditions which the surface of Mars may offer,
if experienced gradually through successive generations,
would not be inimical to terrestrial life
from the lowest to the highest, including even
man.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrett P. Serviss, in discussing the question
of life, in his book "Other Worlds," said:
"Would it not be unreasonable to assume that
vital phenomena on other planets must be subject
to exactly the same limitations that we find
circumscribing them in our world? That kind
of assumption has more than once led us far
astray even in dealing with terrestrial conditions.
It is not so long ago, for instance, since life in
the depths of the sea was deemed to be demonstrably
impossible. The bottom of the ocean,
we were assured, was a region of eternal darkness
and of frightful pressure, wherein no living
creatures could exist. Yet the first dip
of the deep-sea trawl brought up animals of
marvellous delicacy of organization, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
although curiously and wonderfully adapted to
live in a compressed liquid, collapsed when lifted
into a lighter medium."</p>

<p>One has only to make himself familiar with
the wide range of conditions under which life in
various forms exists on the Earth, to realize that
the introduction of Martian conditions here would
not be such an overwhelming calamity, and if
these conditions could be introduced by minute
increments covering thousands of centuries, it is
not unreasonable to believe that myriads of
forms would survive the change, and among
those that survive would be precisely the kinds
that thrive under the most diverse conditions
here&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;namely, man and the higher hymenoptera,
the ants.</p>

<p>To enumerate, in the broadest way, the variety
of conditions under which life exists here, one
has only to enumerate creatures living in the
deepest abysses of the ocean; high up on the
slopes of the Himalayas; swarming in arctic
seas; withstanding the hot glare of a tropical
sun; living deep in the ground; breeding in the
darkest caves; flourishing in desert regions;
thriving in water below freezing, and again in
water nearly at the boiling point. Professor
Jeffries Wyman, in a memoir on "Living Organisms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>in Heated Water," has collected data
showing that fishes are found living in water
ranging from 104° to 135° Fahrenheit. He also
found that low forms of plant life exist in water
of various temperatures as high as:</p>

<div class="poem-container nobreak"><div class="poem">
<ul>
<li>168° F. observed by Dr. Hooker in Sorujkund;</li>
<li>174° F. observed by Capt. Strachey in Thibet;</li>
<li>185° F. observed by Humboldt in LaTrinchera;</li>
<li>199° F. observed by Dr. Brewer in California;</li>
<li>208° F. observed by Descloizeaux in Iceland.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>

<p>If we consider man alone, we find him at
Aden, on the Red Sea, at a temperature of 130°
in the shade, and in Siberia at 70° below zero;
grovelling in mines deep in the Earth, and living
in great communities ten thousand feet above
sea-level; fighting battles on the slopes of the
Himalayas, at an altitude of 19,000 feet; nomadic
on sterile tracts; sweltering under the glaring
sun of the equator, and existing in regions of
perpetual snow and ice, and without sunlight for
six months of the year. Such are a few of the
varied conditions to which man has become
accustomed since he emerged from his tropical
and arboreal relatives.</p>

<p>The question finally comes down to the effect
of the rarefaction of air on life. An inquiry as
to how far man can stand changes of atmospheric
pressure is of interest in this connection, for we
know that sudden changes are accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
mountain sickness, at great elevations, and caisson
disease under great pressure. Large birds
soar among the high peaks of the Andes and
drop at once to sea-level. I have dredged delicate
mollusks at a depth of one hundred and fifty
fathoms of water and kept them alive for weeks
in an aquarium. Man, while showing a sensitiveness
to changes in barometric pressure when
experienced suddenly, can nevertheless get accustomed
to great ranges of pressure. The
cities of Bogota and Quito are 10,000 feet above
the level of the sea and yet in Quito when De
Saussure, the naturalist, became so ill from the
rarefaction that he could hardly find energy
enough to read his instruments, and his servants,
digging holes in the snow, fainted from the
exertion, the natives were pursuing their various
activities, and bull-fights were going on! One
has only to read the accounts of the English expedition
to Thibet to learn that troops fought in
skirmishes at the height of 19,000 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Douglas W. Freshfield (in "Scot. Geo.
Mag.," April, 1905) gives an account of mountain
sickness in the Sikkim Himalaya. He says the
effect of high altitude was different in different
individuals; some men were entirely free from
it, and among them a Goorkha, who ran back in
a pass at an altitude of 20,000 feet to hurry up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
some loiterers. Another member of the party,
an Englishman, actually gained in weight, and
had an increased appetite. Here, then, are a
few men among a small number, without previous
experience in rarefied air, feeling no disturbance,
and, in one case, actually benefited by it!</p>

<p>The question arises as to what natural selection
would do among a hundred million say,
who, through many centuries, might be subject
to a gradual attenuation of the air. The result
of rarefaction of the atmosphere and the absence
of moisture is associated with marked hygienic
influences. The Hadley Climatological Laboratory
of the University of New Mexico has made
special investigations as to the increased lung
capacity of those living at high altitudes, the
relation of dry soil to health, etc. Important
work has been done by Drs. John Weinzirl, C.
Edw. Magnusson, F.&nbsp;S. Maltby, and Mrs. W.&nbsp;C.
Hadley, and their investigations go to prove that
high altitudes and absence of moisture are favorable
to the health of man on this world, and by
analogy would not be inimical to the survival of
certain forms of life in Mars.</p>

<p>Dr. S.&nbsp;E. Solby (in "Medical Climatology,"
p. 43, 1897), in describing the effects of rarefaction
of the air says: "The amount of air taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>in at each breath becomes greater, and the air-cells,
many of which are at lower altitudes often
unused, are dilated."</p>

<p>If we consider the atmospheric pressure under
which a man can work and live, we find equal
adaptability.</p>

<p>Mr. Gardner D. Hiscox, in his work on "Compressed
Air, Its Production, Uses, and Applications,"
says: "Experience has taught that the
ill effects are in proportion to the rapidity with
which the transmission is made from compressed
air to the normal atmosphere. That while the
pressure remains stationary all subjective phenomena
disappear." He speaks of pressure of
forty or fifty pounds to the square inch, and says
that, at these pressures, taste, smell, and the
sense of touch lose their acuteness.</p>

<p>In the "Engineering Record" for January 23,
1904, there is an interesting article on "Caisson
Disease." It says that twenty pounds pressure
per square inch is common on foundation work
in New York, and that bridge piers have been
built when pressures of nearly fifty pounds were
required. The deepest pneumatic work in New
York was done in the East River gas tunnel, when
the maximum pressure was about forty-seven to
fifty pounds per square inch above atmospheric.
In the gas tunnel four men died from the effects
of heavy pressure, while none died from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
reason under bridge work. The article further
says that ordinarily "strong young men in
proper condition do not suffer from working two
four-hour shifts daily, under pressure up to
twenty-five or thirty pounds; above that limit
injurious effects may be felt," etc.</p>

<p>Let any reasonable man consider the meaning
of these data. Without any selective action on
the race, without even a graded increase of
pressure from boyhood up, these workmen perform
hard labor of stone excavation at these
pressures, and in the same way, without previous
experience, men are fighting battles at 19,000
feet altitude, and in one instance growing fat
at 20,000 feet. Eminent German and French
scientists have studied the effects of pneumatic
pressure by numerous experiments on men and
animals. One experimenter subjected a great
number of dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea-pigs, and
other animals to repeated pressures up to one
hundred pounds, and carefully observed the
effects of the varying conditions, some of which
were fatal, while others were apparently harmless.
The experiments showed that sudden release from
heavy pressures was fatal, but that if three or
four hours were occupied in reducing a pressure
of one hundred pounds, it was harmless.</p>

<p>With these facts one cannot help wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
whether even man himself could not exist on
Mars if allowed time to get accustomed to the
rare atmosphere through thousands of generations
of minute increments of adaptation.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact we use but a small portion
of our lung capacity. Let any one experiment
with himself and observe that after he has
inspired the accustomed quantity of air he can
continue for some time to inspire more air, and
also when he has expired the accustomed quantity
of air in normal breathing, he can continue
to expire a great deal more air. Professor Jeffries
Wyman, the famous lecturer on comparative
anatomy at Harvard, used to tell us that we
ordinarily inspired about twenty cubic inches of
air but we could inspire one hundred cubic inches
more by an effort; also that having expired the
ordinary quantity we could expire a hundred
cubic inches more and when the lungs were
removed from the body, an extra hundred cubic
inches could be forced from them. A surgeon
friend tells me that many men live and work
with the greater portion of both lungs diseased,
and unable to perform their functions.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting inquiry to ascertain
what other species of the animal kingdom has so
wide a range as man. The dog evidently follows
him in all altitudes and at all temperatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
The group of insects to which the bees, wasps,
and ants belong, have always been recognized as
standing highest in intelligence among the invertebrates.
In the great work of Dr. and Mrs.
Peckham on wasps are shown manifestations
of intelligence among the wasps that are simply
startling, and the remarkable work of Miss Adele
M. Fielde on the ants adds greatly to the evidences
of their unique intelligence. The ant
stands among the invertebrates much as man does
among the vertebrates. One has only to state
concretely that ants practise a division of labor;
distinguish certain colors; estimate numbers;
recognize friends and enemies; harvest seeds,
and, it is said, raise them, hence are called agricultural
ants; have insect cows and milk them;
collect leaves which they chop up for the purpose
of raising a kind of fungus upon which they
live; organize raids and fight battles in masses;
enslave other species; build covered ways and
tunnels; and perform other acts of a similar
nature.</p>

<p>Bearing these statements in mind it is an interesting
fact that at altitudes in Arizona, where
man finds it impossible to live except by fetching
water from regions below, the ant, equally dependent
on water, has survived on these high tablelands,
and manages to raise huge colonies. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
wandering over the mesa at Flagstaff, at an
elevation of over 7,000 feet, the extreme dryness
of the ground is indicated by long cracks which
appear on the surface. Here, where hardly any
insect is found except an occasional roaming
butterfly, the ant has survived and is met with
in great numbers. Even a rare solitary insect
known as the velvet ant, and consequently without
communal aid, is found chirping merrily
amidst these arid surroundings.</p>

<p>In this connection, it is interesting to observe
that creatures endowed with the highest intelligence,
both vertebrate and invertebrate, manage
to survive in considerable numbers in regions
devoid of water. One conveys it to his habitations
from lower levels, the other digs wells or
manages to utilize the moisture from the roots
of trees.</p>

<p>I am led to present these few brief memoranda
of my own work in order to meet questions
which would naturally be asked as to
whether I had ever seen Mars through a telescope,
and if so did I make out any markings
or canals.</p>

  <p>DOME OF THE LOWELL OBSERVATORY, FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA</p></div></div>

<p>It was my good fortune to have the privilege
of observing Mars every night at the Lowell
Observatory (see Plate VII) for thirty-four days,
covering an almost complete presentation of the
planet. A few nights were cloudy and no observations
were made. With these exceptions I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
was in the observer's chair several times each
evening. The twenty-four inch refractor of
which I had the use was the last telescope Clark
ever made, and he pronounced it his best one.
This instrument (Plate VIII) is mounted on a
mesa near the town of Flagstaff, Arizona, at a
height of over 7,000 feet above sea-level, in an
atmosphere of remarkable clarity and steadiness.
I have already stated on page 80 my first experiences
in observing and will only present the
brief notes I made at the time of observation.
Better results would have accompanied these
efforts had I followed the custom of Michael
Faraday and asked what was I to look at, what
was I expected to see? I had been somewhat
prejudiced as to the existence of the canals by
the comments of sporadic observers, many of
whom, by the way, had never been able to
see them, and denying that any one else ever
had, straightway proceeded to suggest a theory
to explain their presence! Careful to avoid any
bias in the matter I rigidly refused to allow
either Professor Lowell or his assistants to suggest
where I might find a canal or a marking on
the disk. The night before I left the Observatory
for home I asked Mr. Lowell for the first
time, to indicate the position of some conspicuous
canal which I had not seen. This he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
and examining the region which I supposed he
had indicated on the disk I searched in vain for
the line. In doing so another line was detected
and drawn, and on confessing my failure to see
the line he had described, showed him my drawing,
when he exclaimed, "Why, you have got
it," and sure enough when he showed me his
drawing and repeated the directions he had
given me, I found that I had been looking at
the wrong pole of the planet.</p>

  <p>TWENTY-FOUR INCH TELESCOPE OF THE LOWELL OBSERVATORY, FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA</p></div></div>

<p>In one stage of great discouragement I came
across a statement made by Mr. A. Stanley Williams
which has already been quoted, namely,
that he had to observe continually for two
months before sufficient sensitiveness enabled
him to make out the more delicate markings.
That I might have seen more had I been acclimated,
and had been accustomed to telescopic
observation there is no doubt. The record is
poor enough and yet under the conditions mentioned
the results may be of interest to the
reader.</p>

<p>The expression "poor seeing" in the above
notes must be taken in a comparative sense with
relation to the usual conditions of the atmosphere
of Flagstaff. Poor seeing, therefore, at Flagstaff
would be equal, if not superior, to the best seeing
at much lower levels. An astronomer who resigned
his position in a western observatory for
duties at Mount Wilson, California, told me that
for thirty consecutive nights the seeing was superior
to the best nights he had observed in at
his former post.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>For every single perplexity of interpretation
we encounter in our study of the surface markings
of Mars, the Martian would encounter a
dozen perplexities in interpreting the various
features on the surface of the Earth.</p>

<p>Admitting the conclusions of Lowell of the existence
of intelligence in Mars, and that that
intelligence has been associated for ages with a
planet having only slight elevations of land, a
tenuous atmosphere, a scarcity of water which
has been utilized for ages through artificial channels,
as we have done in various parts of the
world since prehistoric times, having vast tracts
of sterile plains, and, within these sterile tracts
large oases fed by irrigating canals, regions of
sparse vegetation, and no large bodies of water;
with these conditions going beyond the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
of these intelligences, what must be the Martian
interpretation of the surface features of this
world? It is a perfectly fair inquiry, for by
such means we may appreciate the attitude of
some of our interpreters of Mars.</p>

<p>In examining the Earth, then, as we have
examined Mars, the Martian would find large
yellow and reddish areas, extensive greenish
areas, and, besides, large regions of varying shades
of blue, possibly, occupying three-fourths of the
Earth's surface. The yellow areas he would interpret
as desert land, the greenish areas he might
consider vegetation, but what would he make
out of the larger regions of blue? This would
certainly puzzle him, because, unfamiliar with
oceans, he could not believe that such vast tracts
could really be water. He would easily interpret
the polar snow caps, and the waters at their
edges, but the oceans would be impossible to
solve. The suggestion, by some audacious interpreter,
that this vast blue area was water, would
be answered by showing that these so-called
bodies of water bordered vast tracts of sandy
deserts with no canals running into them for
irrigation or navigation purposes. Even the
polar snow caps would be doubted, because they
seemed to extend far down into temperate latitudes;
and on their recedence in summer, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
would be seen no dark, bordering seas as the
result of their melting. The vegetation, instead
of unfolding at the north and gradually extending
southward, would unfold in a contrary
direction, appearing first in south temperate latitudes
and developing northward. The perennial
character of the vegetation in the tropics would
puzzle him. Even if he recognized oases in the
deserts of America and Africa, the results of
Artesian wells or springs, he could not believe
them to be vegetation; for he would detect no
irrigating canals running into them. He would
come to the conclusion that no creature could
possibly exist on the Earth, as the tremendous
force of gravitation with great atmospheric pressure
would forbid the existence of any organic
forms. The immense clouds veiling the surface
must at times suffer condensation, and the impact
of raindrops would, from their velocity and
weight, smash everything in the way of life.
Life, if it existed in forms supported by appendages,
must have legs of iron to sustain its
weight, and a crust like a turtle to be impervious
to raindrops, and this would be contrary to all
Martian analogy. The courses of rivers, if detected,
would puzzle him from their irregularity,
unless he dared to suggest that these long sinuous
channels extending for thousands of miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
were identical to the little rivulets he had studied
near his own poles.</p>

<p>In fact, about the only feature outside the polar
snow caps that he would instantly recognize,
would be the great ice cap of the Himalayas.
India, that vast region extending from latitude
35° nearly to the equator, with its great plains
and sterile regions, with its overpowering heat,
and a dense population, depends for the sustenance
of many of its millions upon the thousands of
miles of irrigating canals, fed from the melting
snow caps of the Himalayas. India has no great
lakes, but in the northern plains great rivers
course their way to the sea. The Ganges and
the Indus and their tributaries derive their waters
from the melting glaciers, and from these, a
most extensive irrigating system of canals and
reservoirs draw their waters. As the heat increases
the ice melts more rapidly, and so more
water is supplied at just the time when it is
most needed. The whole scheme is on so vast a
scale that a Martian would recognize its meaning,
though he would wonder at the tortuous
outlines of the larger canals.</p>

<p>Flammarion has, in a similar manner, presented
the arguments of Martian astronomers
as to whether life exists anywhere but upon the
planet Mars. He says, among other fancies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
that the sapient Martian argues that houses
could not be built on the Earth, on account of
the violence with which building materials,
such as bricks, blocks, etc., would drop, and
thus endanger life. Believing that Mars is
rightly balanced as to temperature, the Earth
being so much nearer the Sun, would be too
hot for life to exist. The Martian conceives
himself to be supremely complete "even to the
point that artists wishing to represent God in
our sanctuaries have figured Him in the image
of a Martian man." The Martian considers
our year too short. In his reflections he says:
"During the period in which one of us attains
the middle age of fifty years those on Earth
have become decrepit old men of ninety-four,
if, indeed, they are not already dead."</p>

<p>Seriously, if there is an intelligence in Mars,
it must have evolved along the same general
lines as intelligence has developed on the
Earth. Being an older planet, it must have
outgrown many of the vagaries and illusions
which still hamper man in his progress here.
In the dim past, however, we can imagine
some Martian astronomer with the enigma of
our Earth before him, and the great vault of
heaven with its thousands of riddles unanswered,
consulting records and covering pages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
with mathematical formulæ to ascertain the
precise spot upon which grew the bean stalk
by which a Martian Jack ascended to encounter
the giant. Indeed, the imagination can
conjure up an infinite number of parallels.
If Mars is an older sphere, we trust it has
long outgrown the superstitions which still
hamper man in his interpretation of the inexorable
phenomena of Nature on this little
planet. We may hope that they have finally
reached that stage when a dictum similar to
that of Huxley forms an engraved tablet in
their temples of worship. These are his words:
"Science is teaching the world that the ultimate
court of appeal is observation and experiment,
and not authority. She is teaching
it to estimate the value of evidence; she is
creating a firm and living faith in the existence
of immutable moral and physical laws, perfect
obedience to which is the highest possible aim
of an intelligent being."</p>

<p>The two astronomers most widely known in
connection with the study of Mars are Professor
Giovanni Schiaparelli and Professor Percival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Lowell. Lowell had just graduated from Harvard,
at the age of twenty-one, when Schiaparelli,
at the age of forty-two, made his first great
discovery of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i> of Mars. Macpherson,
in his valuable history of the "Astronomers of
To-day," says of Schiaparelli: "His studies of
meteoric astronomy, of Mars, Venus, and Mercury,
of double stars and of stellar distribution,
have given him a place second to none among
living students of the heavens." From the same
interesting book we gather the following facts:
Schiaparelli was born in Sabigliano, in Piedmont,
in 1835. He attended the usual schools
in his native town and then entered the University
of Turin as a student of mathematics
and architecture. Before he was twenty years
old he decided to devote himself to the study
of astronomy. At the age of twenty-four he
was an assistant in the celebrated Observatory
of Pulkova. When the kingdom of Italy was
organized he became an assistant in the Brera
Observatory, Milan. He became suddenly famous
at the age of twenty-seven by the discovery
of a new asteroid. In 1862 he became Director
of the Observatory. Schiaparelli's first great
discovery was the relationship between comets
and meteoric showers. In 1872 he was accorded
the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Society for his various astronomical discoveries.
Professor Simon Newcomb gives him high praise
when he says: "Among the individual observers
Schiaparelli may be assigned the first place in
view of his long continued study of the planets
under a fine Italian sky, the conscientious minuteness
of his examinations, and his eminence
as an investigator." Schiaparelli's researches
into the relation of comets and meteors "were
developed in 1873, in his remarkable work 'Le
Stelle Cardenti,' which is, according to Sir Norman
Lockyer, one of the greatest contributions
to astronomical literature which the nineteenth
century has produced." Macpherson closes his
interesting memoir of Schiaparelli by saying:
"His devotion to astronomy, his singularly accurate
observations and his wonderful discoveries
have secured for him an exalted position among
the greatest astronomers of modern times." For
a further appreciation of the work of Schiaparelli
the reader is referred to Macpherson's "Astronomers
of To-day." In this brief sketch the reader
may judge of the eminent character of one who
insists that the lines in Mars are a persistent
feature of its surface, whatever one's interpretation
of them may be.</p>

  <div class="caption">PERCIVAL LOWELL</div></div>

<p>Percival Lowell was born in Boston in 1855.
He was graduated from Harvard in 1876, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
prepared for his graduating thesis an essay on
the Nebular Hypothesis. Lowell is a many-sided
man. Early interested in mathematics, he
became one of the founders of the Mathematical
and Physical Society of Boston. A visit to
Japan, where he lived a number of years, resulted
in the writing of three interesting books: "The
Soul of the Far East," 1886; "Noto," 1891;
and "Occult Japan," 1894. During his residence
in Japan he was chosen foreign Secretary and
adviser to the Korean Special Commission, then
about to visit the United States, which he
accompanied. On his return to Korea he was
the guest of the Korean Government, and this
experience prompted him to write "A Korean
Coup d' État," 1894, and his well-known volume,
"Choson, the Land of the Morning Calm," 1885.
On his return to America he undertook an eclipse
expedition to Tripoli with Professor Todd. His
early interest in astronomical subjects was now
fully awakened, and the red planet, which he
had observed in boyhood with a small telescope
from the roof of his father's house, aroused his
interest on account of the heated discussions
over Schiaparelli's discoveries. With an impetuosity
and enthusiasm which characterizes all
his work, he set about to secure a proper region
and a sufficient elevation for an observatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
site. This was found in northern Arizona at
an elevation of over 7,000 feet. Here, then,
was established the Lowell Observatory with
a twenty-four inch refractor made by Clark
especially for this Observatory, the last, and,
according to the maker's words, the best telescope
he had ever made. Lowell insisted that
the location of an observatory was a much more
important factor than the size of the instrument,
and says: "When this is recognized, as it eventually
will be, it will become the fashion to put
up observatories where they may see rather than
be seen." It may be said with truth that, for
the first time in the history of astronomy, an
observatory has been erected and fitted for the
special purpose of studying the surface features
of Mars. During unfavorable oppositions Lowell
has turned his attention to the other planets,
notably Mercury and Venus, with the result of
adding many new and interesting details concerning
these bodies. Three volumes of quarto
memoirs and many bulletins from the Lowell
Observatory attest to his industry. He has
been fortunate in securing talented assistants,
and their contributions may be found in the
various publications of the Observatory. The
character and importance of Lowell's work may
be understood by stating that the "British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Nautical Almanac" is to adopt for the future the
value of the position of the axis of Mars, and the
tilt of the planet's equator to its ecliptic, which
was furnished by Professor Lowell in compliance
with a request.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell is a Fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences; Member of the
Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain; American
Philosophical Society; Société Astronomique
de France; American Astronomical and Astrophysical
Society; Astronomische Gesellschaft;
Société Belge d'Astronomie; Fellow of the
American Geographical Society; Honorary Member
Sociedad Astronomica de Mexico; and others.</p>

<p>In 1904 he was awarded the Janssen medal of
the Astronomical Society of France for his researches
on Mars.</p>

<p>Mr. Macpherson, in his memoir on Lowell, says
that "Mr. Lowell, by his unwearied devotion to
astronomy, has already gained for himself an
enduring reputation."</p>

  <div class="caption">HENRI PERROTIN</div></div>

<p>M. Henry Perrotin and his assistant, M. Thollon,
have been quoted in previous pages as
having markedly confirmed the discoveries of
Schiaparelli. Through the courtesy of Professor
Lowell I am enabled to present the likenesses
of these two astronomers. I am indebted to the
exhaustive work of Miss Agnes M. Clerke, entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the "History of Astronomy during the Nineteenth
Century," for the following memoranda
of some of the work accomplished by these men.
Perrotin made a series of observations on Venus
fully confirming Schiaparelli's inference of synchronous
rotation and revolution: "A remarkable
collection of drawings made by Mr. Lowell
in 1896 appeared decisive in favor of the
views of Schiaparelli." In other words, Venus,
like the Moon, presents the same face to the Sun
in its revolution about that luminary. Perrotin
has made important observations on the rings of
Saturn; his double-star measurements are also
considered work of the highest character.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="ip_178" src="images/i219.jpg" width="312" height="412" class="noborder" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="caption">M. THOLLON</div></div>

<p>Thollon has made many spectroscopic studies,
among which were delicate experiments showing
the lateral displacement of lines in the solar
spectrum arising from the Sun's rotation. In
the Annals of the Nice Observatory he published
a great atlas consisting of thirty-three
maps, exhibiting in quadruplicate a subdivision
of the solar spectrum under varied conditions of
weather and zenith distance. He also studied
the spectrum of the great comet of 1882, and by
the displacement of its lines estimated that the
comet was receding from the Earth at the rate
of from sixty-one to seventy-six kilometers per
second. The Leland prize was awarded to Thollon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
for a hand drawing he made of the prismatic
spectrum obtained with bisulphide of carbon
prisms of high dispersive power.</p>

<p>The character and reputation of these men, as
well as others who have been quoted in these
pages, must be weighed against the few who, not
content with denying the existence of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i>
in Mars, have in strong language abused those
who accept them as veritable markings on the
planet's surface.</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="smcap">John Stuart Mill.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The final question is, do the lines as depicted
and described by various observers exist on the
surface of Mars? Those who have made the
greatest addition to our knowledge of the character
of these lines, and have constructed maps
based on Martian latitude and longitude are
accredited on other grounds as being endowed
with remarkable acuteness of vision coupled
with persistence and painstaking care in observation.
The most successful work has been
accomplished with instruments of fine definition
in regions of steady atmosphere and high altitude,
or at intervals of clarity and steadiness
in regions otherwise unfavorable. Finally, and
most convincing of all, Mr. Lowell's assistant,
Mr. Lampland, after many attempts has succeeded
in photographing the more conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
linear markings. <em>The lines do exist essentially as
figured by Schiaparelli and Lowell.</em> It now rests
with the objectors to suggest any better interpretation
of the markings of Mars than that
they are the results of intelligent effort.</p>

<p>The mediæval attitude of some astronomers
regarding this question recalls the story of Scheiner,
a Jesuit brother, who, independently of Galileo
and Fabricius, discovered spots on the Sun.
Eager with enthusiasm he informed his Superior
of his remarkable discovery and begged to be
allowed to publish it to the world. The Superior
replied, "Go, my son; tranquilize yourself and
rest assured that what you take for spots on the
Sun are the faults of your glasses or of your
eyes." This happened three hundred years ago,
and yet to-day a few astronomers of this class
still survive.</p>

<p>If one will calmly reason about the matter,
let him consider a parallel case of interpretation.
He digs out from the ground a fragment
of stone; its somewhat symmetrical shape suggests
to him the idea that it may be a rude
stone implement. If he wishes to know what
kind of rock it is and its geological age, he
refers it to a geologist; if he wishes to know its
composition, he asks a mineralogist, who, if necessary,
will analyze it for him. If, however, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
is curious to know whether its peculiar, fractured
surface is due to frost or other natural
agency, or whether it is the work of some rude
savage, he inquires of an archæologist, who
alone will be able to tell him whether it is a
worked stone or natural fragment. He will
probably tell him whether it was shaped by paleolithic
man, and whether it is a rough stone
implement or a core, <em>reject</em> or chip. So with the
study of Mars, as we have already pointed out,
there are certain matters of information about
the planet which the astronomer alone can impart,
while the superficial markings are just as
certainly to be interpreted by another class of
students who may or not be familiar with astronomical
methods.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was quite natural that astronomers, the
most conservative of all classes of observers,
should have doubted the first announcement of
Schiaparelli of the startling discovery of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canali</i> marking the face of the planet, the more
so as year after year went by and yet with
the utmost efforts of astronomers nothing of
the nature of Schiaparelli's lines could be seen.</p>

<p>What added greatly to the doubt about
the lines, and at the same time strengthened the
idea that the lines were illusory, was the subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
announcement by Schiaparelli&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;undeterred
by the universal skepticism&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;that at times the
lines appeared double. What more convincing
evidence could be offered than that the phenomenon
was purely subjective?</p>

<p>A few astronomers expressed their doubts in a
courteous though hesitating manner. Professor
Young, in his valuable text-book, "Elements
of Astronomy" (1890), in correctly reporting
Schiaparelli's discovery says: "He is so careful
and experienced an observer that his results
cannot be lightly rejected; and yet it is not
easy to banish a vague suspicion of some error
or illusion, partly because his observations have
thus far received so little confirmation from
others, and partly because his 'canals' are so
difficult to explain. They can hardly be <em>rivers</em>,
because they are quite straight; nor can they
be <em>artificial</em> water-ways since the narrowest of
them are forty or fifty miles wide. To add
to the mystery, he finds that at certain times
many of them become <em>doubled</em>,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the two
which replace the former single one running
parallel to each other for hundreds, and sometimes
thousands, of miles, with a space of 200
or 300 miles between them. He thinks that
this <em>gemination</em> of the canals follows the course
of the planet's seasons."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
The overpowering belief that this world alone
sustained creatures of intelligence formed an
obstructive barrier to any and all attempts
made to uphold&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;at least by analogy&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
idea of intelligence in other worlds. One cannot
but regret that some philosopher had not,
years before Schiaparelli's time, expressed the
conviction that Mars might perhaps be more
favorable to the existence of intelligent life
than our own world, and with this conviction
proceed to formulate the conditions which must
of necessity exist: namely, that the planet
being a much older world than ours, its waters
had mostly vanished by chemical combination
with the rocks and otherwise. Following
this assumption, the philosopher might have
insisted that in the last extremity the melting
snow caps would be utilized by the supposed
intelligences to furnish water for potable and
irrigating purposes. The philosopher might
have superadded to this idea the prediction
that, when telescopes were strong enough and
eyes were keen enough, evidence of the truth
of this supposition would be found in canals
of some sort and that such lines should be carefully
sought for. Fancy the exultation of
Schiaparelli when at last he found the lines
precisely as indicated. Such an announcement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
from so distinguished an astronomer would have
been hailed with acclaim. Alas! for the conservatism
of astronomers, such powers of prevision
are sadly wanting. Le Verrier's prediction of
an outer planet was a matter of dead certainty.
The perturbations of Uranus could not be accounted
for except by the assumption of an
outside body, and had it not been for the characteristic
reserve of English astronomers, Adams
might have had the full credit. So rare are predictions
of this nature in the history of astronomy
that this instance will probably be quoted to the
end of time. The masses, still ignorant of the
certainty of mathematical astronomy, regard
the prediction of an eclipse as in the nature
of a prophecy. The liberal attitude of naturalists
stands in marked contrast, and the
history of their work is filled with examples
of prediction and repeated confirmations. Until
the middle of the last century&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;grounded in
the belief of special creation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;how wonderfully
rapid was the conversion of naturalists to the
theory of evolution after Darwin had offered
his rational views on the subject. The existence
of forms was predicted, based on the idea
of evolution, and these have been found
again and again. Our museums display in
their cases remains of fossil animals which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
complete many series undreamed of in pre-Darwinian
days. This wonderful work has
been accomplished without resort to algebraic
formulæ, and yet when mathematics can be
applied, as it is in the law of variation, quantitative
studies in heredity, and statistical
methods generally, it is promptly seized upon
by the biologist.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>To one unconvinced of the existence of some
signs of intelligent activity in Mars the suggestions
that have been made to account for certain
appearances in the planet will seem absurd. If,
on the other hand, he finds himself in agreement
with those who believe the markings are the
result of intelligent effort, then he is justified in
using the various artificial markings of the surface
of the Earth as standards of comparison in
explaining the many curious markings of Mars.
Indeed, he is compelled to do so, just as would
be demanded of him if he should stand on some
high mountain peak in some hitherto unexplored
region of Africa and should minutely scan the
hazy stretch of plains below. Large white spots
in equatorial regions which could not possibly be
snow-covered hills, might be masses of white
flowers or cloth-covered areas for the better
cultivation of certain plants. Lines that dimly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
stretched across the surface might be rivers,
cañons, rifts, or bands of irrigation, according to
their character.</p>

<p>As we compare the circular markings on the
Moon with our terrestrial craters and fissures,
and cracks on its surface with similar fissures on
the Earth, so we are forced to compare the markings
on the surface of Mars with what seems
analogous to them on the surface of our own
Earth.</p>

<p>Once proved that the markings of Mars are
due to erosion, cracks, encircling meteors big
enough to raise ridges by their attractive force,
then all that has been written in demonstration
of their artificial character goes for naught.
The intelligent reader unprejudiced in the matter
will, however, judge for himself the merits
of our contention and will determine the reasonableness
of the comparisons that have been
made by Lowell in solving the mystery of Mars.</p>

round numbers, at the rate of 186,000 miles a second.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The terminator represents the limit of light on that side
of the planet in the shade, in other words, where the light
terminates. In viewing the Moon, when at quarter or half, the
terminator is seen very ragged on account of the illumination
of higher points on the surface. If the Moon was as smooth
as a billiard ball the terminator would be clear cut.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The world in its ignorance of Italian assumed that the
word meant exclusively canals, and, if canals, then dug by
shovels. What! a canal thirty miles wide and two thousand
miles long dug in the snap of the finger? Impossible conception,
you say. We shall see later the sober utterances of a
member of the British Astronomical Society on this gratuitous
assumption, and an equally serious comment by the chief
assistant of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich (E.&nbsp;S. M.).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The views so long held that the dark shaded regions were
bodies of water, or seas, was disproved by the observations of
Pickering and Douglass, who distinctly traced the course of the
canals across these dark areas. The observations of Dr. E.
Barnard certainly sustain the contention that they are land
areas and probably depressions, representing ancient ocean beds.
Dr. Barnard, using the telescope at the Lick Observatory, says:
"Under the best conditions these dark regions which are always
shown, with smaller telescopes, of nearly uniform shade, broke
up into a vast amount of very fine details. I hardly know how
to describe the appearance of these 'Seas' under these conditions.
To those, however, who have looked down upon a mountainous
country from a considerable elevation, perhaps some conception
of the appearance presented by these dark regions may be had.
From what I know of the appearance of the country about Mt.
Hamilton, as seen from the Observatory, I can imagine that, as
viewed from a very great elevation, this region, broken by
cañon, and slope and ridge, would look like the surface of these
Martian seas."</p></div>
